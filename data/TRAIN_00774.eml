Re: Snow Leopard, Java 6 and NetbeansHas anyone tried it with the 10M3050 or 9M3150 developer preview? I'm =
somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between Java 5 =
and Java 6 - however there are several other factors that can impact =
memory use:

- 32 vs. 64-bit (biggest culprit)
- 1.5/client/32-bit tuned garbage collection options running on =
1.6/server/64-bit
- client vs. server HotSpot itself (more aggressive compilation and =
storage of compiled code)

Anecdotally, I've talked to several people who have large long running =
64-bit processes on Snow Leopard with 2GB-of-RAM machines who were =
having a miserable time. While reverting to 32-bit may be a quick fix =
for some, others who tuned the GC parameters or turned on =
-XX:+UseCompressedOops (which compresses Java references to 32-bit =
values in the heap) found that they could reclaim or even exceed their =
original 32-bit performance (since they were still using the server =
JVM).

Since someone mentioned that NetBeans 6.9 Beta was working well, I'd =
suggest taking a look at it's JVM options and see if there wasn't some =
tweaking done to optimize it for a 64-bit by default world.

Best of luck,

issue with Snow Leopard and Java 6 that makes Netbeans 6.8 near =
unusable. (I've had to do my development on a lesser-powered PC because =
there, things will actually open without pegging the CPU at 100% and =
becoming unresponsive.) Following a tip, I used Pacifist to reinstall =
Leopard's Java 5 back onto the system, set it as the default, and tried =
to launch Netbeans. Lo and behold, it was fast, responsive and showed =
none of the problems I'd been used to. Unfortunately, it made it so that =
I couldn't work on my Java 6-based app!
