Re: [ILUG] RH7.3 on Cobalt - the saga continuesOn Tue, Aug 13, 2002 at 06:54:28AM +0100, Anders Holm mentioned:

 Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 The only way I think you can set parameters is with a "set_params" line.

 However, when I run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.
