I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.

An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

Yup!
