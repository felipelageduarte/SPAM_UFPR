[Razor-users] honor is not in cslFolks, 

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue server.
There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is acting
as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely turning off
catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor with the -rs
option, please take it out and let the agents discover a closeby
catalogue server.

cheers,
vipul.
