Mmm, those instructions seems pretty old (2006-2007), maybe something has 
changed since then.

Two more hints:

1/ The error message you got was:

***
(...)
Cannot find codec for audio format 0x726D6173.
Read DOCS/HTML/en/codecs.html!
***

So follow their wise advice and take a look into that doc file. 

2/ Dunno if you already installed the mpeg/ffmpeg versions from "debian-
multimedia" repo, as Ron already pointed out. That could be another thing 
you can test.
