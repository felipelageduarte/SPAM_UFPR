This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have 
an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted 
hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a 
monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of "renting" the 
system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to 
decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled 
and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.

This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  

What do you think ?
