Hahaha...  Who want to use this KDE crap?

On my test Workstation I had to install over 400 MByte of KDE crap  even
if I do not use KDE...  KDE and GNOME are the  most  unreliable  Desktop
Envirement ever coded.

I can not even run some progams on my ARM  Workstation which is based on
the "Marvel Armada 300" with 2 GHz and 1 GByte of memory du to a  memory
problem with KDE.

Thanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening
