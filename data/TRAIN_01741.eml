        I've used it, of course.  Kpackage is much easier.  It's rare I say
that about a GUI utility vs. a CLI one, but in this case it's true.

        Neither of those comments are helpful.  Without KPackage, KDE isn't
much use.

        That's just nonsense.  Many packages simply do not have Debian sources,
and I have used KPackage to successfully install many alien packages. 
In some cases, there may be a reasonable .deb subsitute, but many
packages, most notably hardware drives, simply have no substitute.  Two
of my RAID controllers, for example, only have RPM distros.  Surely you
are not suggesting a PC - Debian or otherwise - can do without its hard
drives?  They installed fine under KDE3.
