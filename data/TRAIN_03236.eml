It came out a while ago, but Ben Hammersley reviewed AmphetaDesk and a few 
other free aggregators in his Guardian article, Working the web: Newsreaders[1]
. In more timely news, OSDir[2], a repository of "stable, open source apps", 
has reviewed AmphetaDesk[3] and labels it an 'OSDir.com preferred' app. They 
also give you the ability to rate AmphetaDesk[4] on a scale of 1-10. You can 
see the current rating here[5].
