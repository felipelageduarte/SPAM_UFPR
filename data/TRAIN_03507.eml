I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of 
report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the 
one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the 
majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your 
trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither 
against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
"gray" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor 
bad, just... gray)
