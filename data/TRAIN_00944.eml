To paraphrase something I heard once:
Unless you like looking for a new job, never install a non-released or
development-only version of software anywhere where the results of such
code are important.

ie: Don't run development code on a production machine. :)


The problem isn't SA anyway, it looks for Razor1 and just keeps on
going if it can't find it.  Something came up about amavis on the SA
list where it looks for Razor itself...
