(Not disagreeing with the general point.)

For what it's worth, I've been running Eclipse (on 10.6, 64-bit) with
the UseCompressedOoops option for months now - if anyone recalls, Apple
fixed the issue with the default garbage collector so that it now
automatically chooses one that doesn't crash with that option - and it's
very fast.

Of course, I only have my work computer to compare it against (which is
a Pentium 4 PC, with a hard drive that appears to have some kind of
identity issue, since it obviously thinks it's a C64 cassette) - but
still, I don't notice any performance problems.

Also note, I'm sure the behaviour is different on different benchmarks.
I did a quick search and found two benchmarks:

http://www.matsim.org/book/export/html/330
http://blog.juma.me.uk/tag/compressed-oops/

As it happens, both these show a performance win for the option, but
these are only two samples. I'm sure certain usage patterns are indeed
noticeably slower so I agree, if using CPU-critical code where
performance is a concern, it's probably best to work out a repeatable
test and try both options. Just saying, 'assuming' is never a good idea,
but don't assume it'll be slower either. :)
