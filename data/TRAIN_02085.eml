[Razor-users] can't call method "log" issue - solution
I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,
but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run 

razor-admin -create

and

razor-admin -discover

with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.

The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.

razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover

hth,
Steve
