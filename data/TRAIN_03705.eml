"10.00.Custom" is the
default value for --revision.  The fact that you see it in the package
file name means that it did not recognize the option.  Try it this way:

   fakeroot make-kpkg clean
   fakeroot make-kpkg --append-to-version -recompiled --revision x.x.xxx \
    --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers

Note: you must always issue "make-kpkg clean" after running "make menuconfig"
or after running "make-kpkg" with any target other than "clean".  Otherwise,
version and revision numbers will not work as expected.  Assuming that you
are using official Debian kernel sources, you will want to make the value
for --revision match the "version" of the linux-source-2.6.32 package.
I know the web page I pointed you to is long and boring.  But the answers to
all of your problems are in there.  Where did you get your kernel sources,
by the way?  And why are you compiling a custom kernel in the first place?
