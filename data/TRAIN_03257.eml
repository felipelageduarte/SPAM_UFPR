oh yes, see you've setup that tdma thingy, so here's a thought. do
you reckon spammers (or the software they use) is/are smart enough to

	s/\(.\)+\+.*@\([a-zA-Z\.0-9\-]\)/\1@\2/

on email addresses? it's a fairly old trick, so i dont see why they
wouldnt.

personally, i rarely get spam to any of the plussed addresses
i've given out - i think i've only ever gotten /one/ cause ebay 
seem to have sold on my address. apart from that - never, not even 
to +usenet, so i wonder whether harvesting software does the above.
