They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]
