Sure? I don't think so :-)

"Bonding" is for ethernet devices, nothing to do with using your 
"router's bandwith". Ethernet bonding is like hard disk raid: it will 
prevent for a "link" going down and you can use it to increasing 
throughput but what you want to achieve is not done with that, as you 
will be still facing the problem on how/where to route packages.

Also, bonding requires at least 2 ethernet adapters. 

A very good bonding tutorial:

But you may need something like this:
