Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)

What I've done instead is to create a tiny little "kernel.spec" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.
