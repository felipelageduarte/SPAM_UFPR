Interestingly, if I grab the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the size of the entire applet window.  If I grab the firefox window, I just get the firefox window display.  I guess this makes sense since the applet runs in a separate process, though I don't understand why the applet display is getting messed up.  Maybe this is a clue to where the problem lies.

I installed 10M3050 and it looks like overall a big improvement.  In 
particlar, the rendering errors I've seen are gone.  However, I have 
noticed one new problem which I don't think was present in the previous 
version of the plugin.  I can't (mouse) drag inside an applet in Firefox. 
Dragging works in Safari.  If I open

http://pivot.apache.org/demos/decorators.html

I can't move the "window" by dragging the title bar.  Also, if I open

http://pivot.apache.org/demos/itunes-search.html

and search for "beethoven" I cannot drag the scrollbar.  Do you have the 
same problem?

Cheers,

Michael
