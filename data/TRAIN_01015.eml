[Razor-users] Re: Can't call method "log" with SA/Razor2This is happening due to insufficient write access to the
"razor-agent.log" file. I was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user.  As a quick workaround, you can do
"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".

In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. Then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the "unblessed reference" error.

Hope that helps,
Michael
