Re: FromThis is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
mh.

Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
server to escape lines beginning with "From " if they choose to turn on that 
facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
rely on "Content-length:" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
unaware of "Content-length:", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
spool.

I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:

1)  Get your mail administrator to add the "E" flag to your sendmail.  This 
means you will never see a line beginning with "From ".  Any such line will 
look like ">From ".

2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect "Content-length:".  When I was 
having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.

3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
everything works.
