apt.conf suggestionHi,

how about applying this to the default apt.conf shipped with the
freshrpms.net apt package?  I found it a bit weird when the behaviour
changed between the old 0.3.x and the new 0.5.x versions so that when
doing a "apt-get upgrade", it wouldn't tell me *which* packages were to
be upgraded, just that it was about to upgrade something...
