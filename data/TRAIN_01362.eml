why not just limit it to the ip address you want currently only 2

server 1: ip route add 207.154.59.130 dev eth0  src 207.154.13.48
server 2: ip route add 207.154.13.48 dev eth0 src 207.154.59.130

just put in routing statements for the ip's that you need

iproute is the new route

place them in /etc/network/interfaces as post-up command don't forget
|| true at the end of the command
