RE: [SAtalk] separate inbound and outbound
No I was just a little confused because I'm running procmail on a gateway
and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead
server.  So there isn't any delivery to the local system.

The only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we're looking to get rid
of complication and go back to two boxes.  I did a test which looked like
you guys are right about procmail, but testing is very limited due to the
config I currently have.  It's just confusing when set up as a gateway.

Using procmail, SpamAssassin doesn't get called for outgoing email
(messages sent to other machines). 
Procmail=Local Delivery Agent => inbound traffic to LOCAL machine.
