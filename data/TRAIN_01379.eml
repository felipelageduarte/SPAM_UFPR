Re: Minor whoops with glimpse supportThere are some cases like this with "incomplete ftoc".  These are surely old
bugs that appeared after I added the ability to only scan the tail of the ftoc
if for some reason the scan module decides it cannot easily merge the newly
scanned (scan unseen) into the tail of the cached scan listing.  Hmm - I poked
around a bit. glimpse.tcl uses Msg_Change, which has code in it to try and
deal with showing a message that isn't in the ftoc:
        Exmh_Status "Cannot find msg $msgid - Rescan?"
Is that message hiding in your log?  Perhaps there should be a return from
Msg_Change that glimpse.tcl can use to decide what to do next.
