RE: [Razor-users] Ricochet Question Actually

formail did the trick. Thanks to those who answered. For the sake of
archives, here's how to "patch" ricochet:


1. procmailrc (/tmp/pmrc):

RICOCHET=/usr/local/etc/ricochet
PMDIR=/tmp
LOGFILE=$PMDIR/pmlog
VERBOSE=yes
MAILDIR=/tmp
LOGABSTRACT=all

:0 f
| /usr/local/bin/ri2


2. /usr/local/bin/ri2 (to test):

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/ricochet -DONT_SEND >/tmp/rico.$$

3. formmail exec:

formail -ds procmail /tmp/pmrc </tmp/spm

-end-

Sorry for such brief instructions. The only problem here is that I get
another copy of the spam in the spambox again. This can be fixed with some
procmailrc tweaking (the ":0 f" part).

Cheers,
-zeek
