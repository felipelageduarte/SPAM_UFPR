Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but
rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his
views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more
coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting
meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather
the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.

Point the second. Historicaly the "in yer face" mode of confrontation has
been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds "grass roots"
movements. Witness the big bold "in yer face" signature of Hancock on the
"in yer  face" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing
powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in
examplare  form upon digging.

Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the "in
yer facers" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are
teh very fule the "in yer facers" hope to ignite. If your burning, your
being used.

Pointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the
refuge of backstabings,  closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal
behavoirs. Id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than
quietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward.



Seek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why.
