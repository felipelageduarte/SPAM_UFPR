Re: Supporting Apple Remote from a Java app?The email thread below is from fall of 2006.
I don't supposed anyone has any new comments to add to this question?

iremoted is still popular ( http://danbri.org/words/2009/10/18/478 ).   
And the license looks friendly.

Also I noticed this:
http://www.martinkahr.com/2007/07/26/remote-control-wrapper-20/index.html

Does anyone have any first hand experience with these or other  
possibilities?
