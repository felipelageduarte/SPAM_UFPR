http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character
     A bell code (sometimes bell character) is a device control
     code originally sent to ring a small electromechanical bell
     on tickers and other teleprinters (remote printers) and
     teletypewriters (such as Teletypes, abbreviated TTYs) to
     alert operators at the other end of the line, often of an
     incoming message
