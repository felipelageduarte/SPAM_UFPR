Header forgeries are trivially easy to detect. The main way that 
spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, 
but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that 
spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the 
originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, 
and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many 
ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.

One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, 
and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a 
fairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his 
meatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once 
you have legal recourse to subpoena records.
