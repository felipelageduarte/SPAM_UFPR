strange issue after upgrading to latest 10.6.3Hi folks,

I *think* this happened after upgrading to 10.6.3, but I also recall
there was a security patch, I apologize because I was sort of
absentmindedly updating myself which I hadn't done in a while.  So...er,
not exactly sure what the cause is.  But, the issue is this:

When I'm using X11/XQuartz (I've just tried the default xterm as well as
rxvt I installed via macports), what seems to happen is that I can open
a terminal and use it for a little while, but if I leave x11, that is if
it looses focus, and then I come back, I can no longer switch between
windows, enter anything with the keyboard, click and select windows with
my mouse, etc.  All input to x11 seems to be dead.  I have to kill it
and then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same
thing happens.  I've tried reinstalling it but that hasn't helped.

Does this behavior ring a bell to anyone?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated, I live in rxvt and don't like using Terminal.app very much!

Thanks--

Dave
