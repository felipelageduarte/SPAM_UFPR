[Razor-users] problems with hubris and/or discoverytrying to report spam [razor chooses hubris] I timeout on the connection
(which seems to have gotten slower all morning) and receive the following
error message:

razor-report error: connect4: nextserver: discover1: Error reading socket
connect4: nextserver: discover1: Error reading socket

I then try to run razor-admin -discover and receive the same error .....
problems with the servers today? only one discovery server?
