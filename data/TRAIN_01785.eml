O.k. That seems now reasonable :-)

Yep. I told you that some devices display this message. It happens to me 
*always* with my mobile phone. It does not happen with standard usb flash 
disk, though.

Which means it has been umounted.

I get the same behaviour than you, but only when I attach a special 
device (GNOME recognizes the mobile phone as some kind of music stuff). 

Try this:

1/ Plug on the device
2/ Type mount (to get the device listed)
3/ Type "umount /media/video" (adjust the command to point the right path)
4/ Type "mount"

With these steps I get no pop-up or warning messages and the device gets 
umounted normally.
