at least it sucks up memory without releasing it afterwards

The whole virtuoso/strigi ensemble needs a lot of polishing. It is not ready 
for simple usage yet.
I have spent some days fiddling with that stuff based on my own experience and 
feedback i got from users at sidux.
The best way i found to have a usable index is:
 - stop nepomuk and strigi in systemsettings
 - move away or delete everything in: 
~/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository/main/data/virtuosobackend
(there might be incompatible database from virtuoso 5.x in there)
 - out and back in to your account
 - start nepomuk andv strigi
 - let it do the indexing
 - test (in dolphin, krunner is unreliable atm) your index
 - see if e.g. files under kmail got indexed

for me to have a complete index i had to do 5 runs of strigi.
in the first 3 runs it would not even touch any dot files under .kde
in the end it works fine now but popular searches use a lot of ram.
