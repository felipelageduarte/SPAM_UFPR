No, I am not aware of that. I also don't use Kmail.

No. Do you customarily read the complete email headers of those whom
with which you correspond?

I  cannot use Kmail until two feature requests are implemented:
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D72926
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D159251

Thunderbird has this implemented as an extension:

I have done tens of KDE 4 installs, and filed or triaged over 1300
bugs at KDE. I have installed KDE-based systems for home users,
students, university laboratories, a library, and some small home

already?
