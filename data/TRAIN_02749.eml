Good question.  This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky
and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.

It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  

The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.
