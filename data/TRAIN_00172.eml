I have the same, and it works for me.

Run xev from a terminal window. If you move the mouse cursor into the 
window that pops up, hold it still there and click the middle button, 
you should see something like this:

ButtonPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302587, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x0, button 2, same_screen YES

ButtonRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302722, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x200, button 2, same_screen YES

If it says button 2, your X11 setup is okay. If not, please run this 
command and tell us the output:

   defaults read org.x.x11

If your xev run does give you button 2 events, then there is probably 
something wrong with your window manager setup.
