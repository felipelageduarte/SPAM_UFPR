There shouldn't be any long-term implications as long as the old KResource
code still exists.  I'm assuming it's being deprecated as of KDE 4.4, but
I'd be surprised if it's removed in KDE 4.5, especially since delaying
migration is an official recommendation.

Once the DB mess is sorted out (KDE 4.5?), one can manually migrate the
data by running "kres-migrator".  I actually did this accidentally.  The
migrator _might_ also run if we remove the configuration bit, but I've not
tried.

It extends beyond just a change in package behavior, it's a non-reversible
and potentially aggravating alteration to user data.  I've seen similar
warnings before, most recently to rebuild OpenOffice.org .rdb files due to
possible corruption.

Forgot to mention before, apparently there's an Innodb_log_waits counter
that increments when you have write bursts that exceed the REDO log size.
It can be used for feedback to increase the log size if needed.  Perhaps
something to suggest manually doing in NEWS.

Should have same problem, if one runs a KDE desktop as root, which I do
not.
