Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including "betagenics", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,
A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
Everyone you meet is your mirror.

You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
waste what you do have.

The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be
in the Eternal Now Moment

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

The
purpose
of our lives
is to be free
of all addictive traps,
and thus
become one
with the ocean of
Living Love.
