Re: Basic authorization not working on QuickTime X player OSStatus
	error -128Hi  Thorston

Thanks for the quick response.

I just got it to work another way by having QuickTime Player 7 open  
before I click the link on the web page which has the embed attribute  
of target="quicktimeplayer".  Quicktime 7 Player then displays the  
authorization dialog and that works correctly.
