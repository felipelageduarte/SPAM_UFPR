Yes, it is...  But then alsa-driver requires alsa-kernel, and I don't quite 
like --nodeps...

That's ok.  I was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway, not 
for some real-world need :).

Um...  I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include 
keyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not 
require kernel-2.4.18-10, so that's ok.
