Thanks both. (@Andrei: it was in the content of the file, sorry not to
have specified it before.)

I am using the second command. The problem is that, for one set of
files (that I have selected, no problem for this), I have to use a
really simple expression: I need to find all the occurences of
`\paragraph{}' and replace them with nothing (i.e. with `'). I know
regexps, but replacing `$regexp' with `\paragraph{}' gives error
messages. Any idea? Thanks.
