(This is all guess work and may be bogus.)

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.
