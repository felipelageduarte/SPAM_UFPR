What makes the non-free firmware question particularly interesting is
that the alternative is often to hardcode the functionality into the
hardware.  Now, if you had a board with completely closed HW, but that
presented an open, well documented interface for the driver, most
people would be very happy (although there are, of course, the open
hardware crusaders - more power to them!).  So, now that they've simply
implemented some of that functionality in SW, in the form of firmware
which the driver installs on the card, but which has nothing to do with
your host machine, are you really any worse off?
