It looks OK to me; your custom rules file is read by udev (line 24) and
the corresponding variables are set (lines 110-116).

I now tried to activate the extra options in the fdi file that comes
with xserver-xorg-input-synaptics and that gave me right-edge-scrolling
and the other stuff. Thus it seems that the fdi directives are working
right now on my Sid system. (As I wrote earlier, I have not used these
features in a long while, therefore I do not know if the fdi files
worked all the time or if this functionality was only recently
restored.)

I suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compare our
results. In other words:

1) Shut down X and remove your custom udev rules for the time being,
   then restart udev. (invoke-rc.d udev restart)

2) Uncomment the extra rules in
   /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi. You have
   to close the comment in the "<!-- EXAMPLES:" line by adding " -->" to
   the end of this line; also insert a new line with "<!--" just before
   the line starting with "For other possible options, check".

3) Restart dbus, which will also restart hal.
   (invoke-rc.d debus restart)

4) Verify that hal is paying attention to the newly-uncommented options;
   the output of
  =20
   lshal -u $(hal-find-by-capability --capability input.touchpad)

   should include:

   input.x11_driver =3D 'synaptics'  (string)
   input.x11_options.CircularScrolling =3D 'true'  (string)
   input.x11_options.HorizTwoFingerScroll =3D 'true'  (string)
   input.x11_options.MaxTapMove =3D '2000'  (string)
   input.x11_options.SHMConfig =3D 'true'  (string)
   input.x11_options.VertEdgeScroll =3D 'true'  (string)
   input.x11_options.VertTwoFingerScroll =3D 'true'  (string)

5) Restart X, then find the synaptics part in /var/log/Xorg.0.log. It
   should contain lines like these:

   (II) config/hal: Adding input device SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad
   (II) LoadModule: "synaptics"
   (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input//synaptics_drv.so
   (II) Module synaptics: vendor=3D"X.Org Foundation"
           compiled for 1.6.5, module version =3D 1.2.0
           Module class: X.Org XInput Driver
           ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 4.0
   (II) Synaptics touchpad driver version 1.2.0
   (**) Option "Device" "/dev/input/event7"
   (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: x-axis range 1472 - 5472
   (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: y-axis range 1408 - 4448
   (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: pressure range 0 - 255
   (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: finger width range 0 - 0
   (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: buttons: left right middle double triple
   (**) Option "SHMConfig" "true"
   (**) Option "MaxTapMove" "2000"
   (**) Option "VertEdgeScroll" "true"
   (**) Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "true"
   (**) Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "true"
   (**) Option "CircularScrolling" "true"

6) Check if VertEdgeScroll and the other stuff works; if it does then
   you can try to add your other options to the fdi file and remove the
   ones that you do not like. Once you are done with the tests you can
   restore 20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi to its original state and
   put your rules into a separate fdi files so that they will not be
   overwritten at the next upgrade of xserver-xorg-input-synaptics.
