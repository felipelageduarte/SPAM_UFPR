- Presuming your run Bash  :
Note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print "$_\n" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB="directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4"
Then try to install the software

PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do 
# man perlrun for more information
