All the stuff at debian-multimedia can't be included in debian for
various reasons, mostly freedom I think, so you won't find it in debian
at all. It's made for debian but it isn't debian.

I started using d-mm.o from the reply to a question I posted in this
list many years ago and I suspect most people still find it today the
same way.
