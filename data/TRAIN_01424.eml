RE: [Razor-users] Reducing impact from tons of emailSee your /etc/sendmail.cf file, there are a number of methods for limiting
the number of concurrent sendmail processes, either by load average (I'm
sure), or concurrency (I think)... I use sendmail anymore (I use qmail) but
I'm sure that if you look in the config file, you will see what you need...

Regards,
Adam
