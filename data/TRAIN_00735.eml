openssh-3.0.2p1-1

I think that is directly from openssh site. It's from the RH 6.2 that I 
upgraded to 7.2 (6.2 doesn't ship with openssh...). 

I probably should downgrade to the versoin RH provides except I can't do 
that as I don't have physical access to that box and downgrading ssh 
packages over ssh doesn't sound like a bright idea...
