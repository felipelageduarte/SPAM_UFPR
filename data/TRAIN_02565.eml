That does of course work, but you might run into issues with protected =
resources, as you won't be able to share credentials/sessions/etc with =
the browser (unless you get a path to the browsers locally cached =
version of the resource).=20

I did some extra testing on this topic, and found there are more things =
going wrong: The "image/x-pict" flavor, which should contain a TIFF =
encoded version of the image, instead contains only a null-terminated =
string "Unsupported type". It's probably caused by the same underlying =
problem that leads to the Error in the "image/x-java-image" case though, =
but might help locating the bug.=20
