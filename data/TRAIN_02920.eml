And yet more absurdity.I knew it'd be a day for insanity.

so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.

Slashdot, of course, links to them.

So now, I link to slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.
