Realizing that the above, after looking at it, is pretty much no help,
changed debug to 9 and output the results to a text file. It is attached but
the crux of the messages resemble:
Jul 31 23:11:14.633544 check[5689]: [ 7] Can't read file
servers.discovery.lst, looking relatve to
Jul 31 23:11:14.634218 check[5689]: [ 5] Can't read file

 or
Jul 31 23:07:19.115412 check[26156]: [ 6] no discovery listfile:
servers.discovery.lst

Jul 31 23:07:19.215833 check[26124]: [ 5] Connecting to 216.52.13.90 ...

It would appear that even though there is a specified home directory,
razor-check cannot read the .lst files and must apparently run discovery at
each lookup?????

This, btw, is occuring on two separate servers ...
