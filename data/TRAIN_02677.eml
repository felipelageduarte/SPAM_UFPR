Netscape 7 ReviewThis is my Netscape 7.0 Review.

o They finally got the email search speed back up to
   where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really
   odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that
   previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
   hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x
   address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume
   it works--which it doesn't)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
   I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single
   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the
   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
   work on something with someone remotely.

I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.
