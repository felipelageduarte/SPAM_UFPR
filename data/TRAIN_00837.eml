Nor is there a Turing Test, even for someone with whom you've spent 11
years, boom, bust and boom again, and 3 children (trust me) There is
no magic litmus test other than the totally empirical: "Try it and
see"

 And matters of the heart,
 People laugh at /anything/
 And things just fall apart."

The only real test, the only /sensible/ test, is to look back and
realize your relationship has lasted 50 years and see no reason to
believe it couldn't last another 50.  In the absense of 50 years of
actual (ahem) hands-on experiential data, a photo and a few words are
as good as any, provided you are prepared for the dynamics of it.

Love is a verb.  Sex is a /shared/ pursuit.  There is no
'relation-ship', there is only the crew.  sail away!
