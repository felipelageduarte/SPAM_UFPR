Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code
