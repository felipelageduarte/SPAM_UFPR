What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word "muddy" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.

Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.
Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I
have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
understand the distinction.

All better?
