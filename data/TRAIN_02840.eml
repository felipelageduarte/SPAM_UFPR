There were four buddies golfing and the first guy said, "I had to
promise my wife that I would paint the whole outside of the house
just to go golfing."

The second guy said, "I promised my wife that I would remodel the
kitchen for her."

The third guy said, "You guys have it easy! I promised my wife that
I would build her a new deck." They continued to play the hole.
Then the first guy said to the fourth guy, "What did you have to
promise your wife?"

The fourth guy replied, "I didn't promise anything." All the guys
were shocked, "How did you do it?!" He replied, "It's simple. I
set the alarm clock for 5:30. Then I poked my wife and asked, 'Golf
course or intercourse?' And she said, 'Wear your sweater.'"
