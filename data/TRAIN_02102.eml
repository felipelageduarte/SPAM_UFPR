JAWT_macosxDRAWINGSurfaceInfo gets the wrong componentI've got a Java application that contains a -panel within a frame and
I want to draw into the panel and the method works on Windows (with OS
specific modification).
However, when I execute the program on a Mac it would appear that
NSView *view = dsi_mac->cocoaViewRef; returns the parent window, which
in this case is the frame.

Is there anyway I can modify the code below to ensure that I always
have the panel as my windows context rather the frame?

        // Get the corresponding peer from the caller canvas
        NSView *view = dsi_mac->cocoaViewRef;
        		
        NSWindow *window = [view window];
        NSGraphicsContext *ctxt = [NSGraphicsContext
graphicsContextWithWindow:window];
        CGContextRef cg = [ctxt graphicsPort];
