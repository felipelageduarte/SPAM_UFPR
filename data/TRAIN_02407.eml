Depends. See the other posts about logrotate

No clue

I am logging to syslog (the protocol) and replaced syslog (the package)
with syslog-ng. syslog-ng can be configured to do this:

destination df_syslog {
        file("/var/log/$HOST/$YEAR/$MONTH/$DAY/syslog"
        template("$ISODATE $HOST $MSG\n")
        owner(root) group(root) perm(0600) dir_perm(0700) create_dirs(yes));
};

This is a snipped that configures a file in a directory-structure matching
the hostname and the date (you should be able to guess the details...)

http://www.syslog.org/syslog-ng/v2/ has some more examples.
