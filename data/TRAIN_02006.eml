[ILUG] PPPD disconnects on me!Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.
Carlos
