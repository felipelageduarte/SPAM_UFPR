The people who pour the espresso aren't rich.  An interesting issue
might be how it affects employment.

Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a
difference.  

The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous.
Worse than the cost of the tax itself.

Me: I hate coffee anyway.  But if they put a $.10/can tax on Diet Dr.
Pepper I might have to start buying them in Oregon.  (Yes, I drink that
much Diet Dr. Pepper).
