As audiences become more and more sophisticated about computer graphics, 
fractal noise and procedural woodgrain textures can no longer guarantee gushing 
reviews. Darkling Simulations’ Darktree 2 is the latest edition of the popular 
tool for artists who want to develop complex, multilayered shaders ranging from 
highly realistic natural surfaces to animated pyrotechnics to flatshaded 
cartoon renderings.
