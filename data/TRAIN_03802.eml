RE: [ILUG] bind + lex + yacc...Never having to support a large network myself, I know very little about

but what do lex & yacc have to do with anything ?

These are language parsers, used to build complilers / interptreters  and
the like???!!!

BIND, ok large networks might need DNS....

Have I missed something completely?
