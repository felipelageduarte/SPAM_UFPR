Re: [SAtalk] Microsoft developer newsletter tagged as spamThis MSDN mail thing reminds me of how I've documented this feature of
SpamAssassin here so that our users understand it.

I define "Solicited Commercial Email" vs "Unsolicited Commercial Email" -
the latter being SPAM. As SpamAssassin basically looks for "Commercial
Email", both get hit, and that's something they must understand.

Our SA documentation further tells users to filter off their SCE before
applying a SA rule - gets rid of 100% of the problem as the users know who
is sending them SCE.
