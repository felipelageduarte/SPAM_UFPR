um.. http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/ integrated into solaris.

Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for 
solaris 9 which gives you afterstep and windowmaker among other stuff. My 
personal favourite at the moment is enlightenment which also has Solaris 
packages available for download.

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the "ok" prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all 
(sorry couldn't resist!)

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.
