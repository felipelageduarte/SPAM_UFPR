I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

"I told you so." never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.
