It skips it. See the /etc/apt/apt.conf file for this.

I've done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it
was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it
"manually" with rpm -U or -F. I think that updates between stable releases
should still be done with the installer since IIRC, sometimes a few
twitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats. It
should work though... I still prefer backuping config files and
reinstalling a clean system when I have the time.
