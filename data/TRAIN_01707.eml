(PGP problem) EXMH hangs during 'Query keyserver'I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	"Check the signature with GnuPG"
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	"Can't check signature: public key not found"
along with a button with the inscription
	"Query keyserver"
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.

If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

Anyone else with this problem?
This is EXMH v2.5 and tcl/tk 8.4a4
