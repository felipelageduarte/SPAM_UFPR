This is what I found too.  The IW add-on "tor button" configuration 
located at

<right mouse click> Preferences/ Proxy Settings

lists 2 options:

(a) Use the recommended proxy settings for my version of Firefox (and a 
checkbox is marked next to the only sub-option "Use Polipo" by default) or
(b) Use custom proxy settings

Hand on heart I could not say when this change took place as I haven't 
been using IW + tor + privoxy for a while, so this came as quite a 
surprise.  There was a recent update to tor though, IIRC, so it may well 
have been during that.
