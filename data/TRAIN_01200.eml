There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
hoping to contact girls, appearing in "alt.teens" and similar groups -
 I just tried a Google Groups search on "Robert Moaby" and some of 
them came top of the list.

Note for Marie - "MT" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.
