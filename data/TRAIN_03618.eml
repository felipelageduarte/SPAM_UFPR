Heyho!

Short note to the KDE packagers since kdenetwork now depends on=20
libkwebkitpart-dev: don't hesitate to NMU (even with zero delay) if it help=
s=20
to get KDE into squeeze faster.  (In any case, and if no bug reports come=20
in, I'll just wait with the next upload until kwebkitpart is in testing.)
