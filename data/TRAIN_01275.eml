According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)

     The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:

          Left - Change to folder.
          Middle - View nested folders.
          Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
          Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
          Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
          Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.

It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you 
can move using only right-click.
