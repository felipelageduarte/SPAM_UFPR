Problem with xquartz 2.5.0Hi !

I'm getting some problems with Xquartz (2.5.0). I'm running on Mac OS =
10.6.3. My problem is the following :

I use the option of the terminal to automatically launch Xquartz when =
launching terminal. It works well, and Xquartz is launched. I can then =
launch applications which need X11, like nedit.

After working, I close all the open X11 windows, I close xquartz and =
terminal with "command-q" keys.
The problems appear here : if I want to relaunch nedit, doing exactly =
the same procedure, I obtain the "can't open display" exit status for =
nedit. However, Xquartz is normally launched.

I don't understand this behaviour. Somebody has an idea ? Probably a =
problem with the environment variables ?

Thank you !
