Yes and I understand that argument, however.
Sometimes I find that if I don't try to write code in the least space
possible or for example become lazy and say

--Bad style
Bool q;

If(q)
	When I should say
If(q==true)
	
Or

--Bad optimization

int a;
a=some_function();
if(a) <--which apparently works but is 'bad coding style'.

That's what I mean about letting the programming tools take care
of the coding.... it's considered 'bad' apparently.

Or for example say you are writing a loop that says

For(a=0;a<strlen(somestring);a++)
{
 some_thing_goes_here();

 if(b=strlen(somestring)-4)
	do_something;

};

when I probably should say

c=strlen(somestring);

For(a=0;a<c;a++)
{
 some_thing_goes_here();

 if(b=c)
	do_something;

};

Of course 'people' always say that the extra call to strlen() will make no
difference on the machines we have 'these days'.

But my machine has 256mb of ram.... not 640k.
