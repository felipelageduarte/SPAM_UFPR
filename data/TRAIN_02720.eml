I tried using module assistant with kernel 2.6.32 and it failed, so I 
downloaded the .run file from nvidia and it built (after issuing "export 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.3") and installed and runs fine here (squeeze amd64).  Did 
you (OP) purge the Debian packages first, and did you use nvidia-xconfig to 
generate a conf file?
