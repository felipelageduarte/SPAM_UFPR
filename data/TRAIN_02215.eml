[SAtalk] spamd can't find...I thought I'd installed razor correctly, but I am seeing the following in my 
logs.  Can anyone give me a hitn?

directory Can't locate object method "new" via package "Net::DNS::Resolver"

/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm line 392, <STDIN> 
line 114.

The only certainty about documentation is that
whoever wrote it "might" have understood it.
The rest of us may not be so lucky.
