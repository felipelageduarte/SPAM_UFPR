Suspend to Disk + blacklisted module = still troublehello,

I am having problems with the uvcvideo module (driver for webcam)
when resuming from Suspend To Disk on Debian Lenny (with the latest
updates) with a 2.6.30 kernel.

When I wanted to blacklist this module for suspend, I noticed that
it is already in /etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules.

My hibernate.conf:
TryMethod suspend2.conf
TryMethod disk.conf
TryMethod ram.conf

=> so I guess I am using SWSuspend2, and suspend2.conf contains
the line:
Include common.conf

And common.conf contains this:
UnloadBlacklistedModules yes

So does this command cause hibernate to read
/etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules, or do I have to add
UnloadModules uvcvideo
?

Thanks in advance,
