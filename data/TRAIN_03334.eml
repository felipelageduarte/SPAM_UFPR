I'm using the Squeeze+KDE4 version of Debian Live installed and it seems
to be Lenny upgraded to Squeeze, it's definitely broken because the
weather widgets will not config, I've seen the problem before on every
Lenny upgrade and it's the only problem I can find, on that system I've
been able to upgrade the kernel with no problem.

I would not recommend Debian Live to anyone looking for a usable system.
