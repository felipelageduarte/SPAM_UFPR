Using KDE 4 for months now; currently 4.4 from experimental.  If that's=20

certainly is far from bug-free, but it's very usable as an everyday desktop.
( Sune & Co: you can consider this a general reportbug --kudos :-)

lrhorer: I recommend you update to the packages that are currently in=20
experimental and check if the problems are still there.  I'm sure bug=20
reports are welcome.  If you can be bothered to do the necessary work and=20

the KDE bug reporting sysstem, then all the better..
