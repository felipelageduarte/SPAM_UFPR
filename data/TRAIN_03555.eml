Deleting some regexp/simple expression from lots of files in a secure way-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

I have many text files (actually .tex files) which contain some
sequence or regexp (it depends on the files) that I would like to
remove. Is there a commandline/GUI for doing this massive edit?

Thanks.
