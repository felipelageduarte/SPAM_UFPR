As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't 
have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on 
it.

I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true 
that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.
