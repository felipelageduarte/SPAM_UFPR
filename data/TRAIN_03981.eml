Mmmm, and there are others that think this is not enough:

"(...) One reason for the lack of excitement over the project in the free 
software world is that it omits "huge amounts" of information needed for 
a complete implementation of Flash. In particular, Savoye points out that 
the announcement contains no mention of the Real Time Messaging Protocol
(RTMP) that is required for the Flash media server. Nor does it mention 
the Sorenson Spark Codec that is used for video encoding in Flash 6 and 
7, and remains the choice of some users still for Flash video because 
other formats convert easily to it. Both may be encumbered by patents 
but, without them, the information that Adobe has released is of limited 
use."

As per the above link, it seems not all the specs have been released or 
made publicly available. There are also some concerns about software 
patents (for using -and distributing- MP3 codecs or FLV).

Anyway, I agree with your "hidden demand" ;-)

Look at PDF. PDF became a ISO/IEC standard but we (at linux) still lack 
for a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional.
