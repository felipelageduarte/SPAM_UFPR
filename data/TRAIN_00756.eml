[Spambayes] can't write to CVS...I'm listed as a developer on SF and have the spambayes CVS module checked
out using my SF username, but I'm unable to write to the repository.  CVS
complains:

    % cvs add unheader.py
    cvs [server aborted]: "add" requires write access to the repository

Any thoughts?
