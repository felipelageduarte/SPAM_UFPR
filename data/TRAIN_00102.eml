Re: What needs to improve in KDE 4?At this moment, for me, kaddressbook?  Akonadi did not  get configured right, I 
had to follow this advice to get it to start working:  
http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=79717&sid=ce96096a96a9d8ca3ebb13105dce3d21&start=10#p137002

Having done that yesterday I noticed that the concept of contact categories is 
missing.  Today I found that I only get empty dialogs when I attempt to edit a 
contact!  So for me kaddressbook is unstable.
