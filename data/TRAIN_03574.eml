Re: Basic authorization not working on QuickTime X player OSStatus
	error -128Hi Martin,

i filed a bug report some months ago. Unfortunately it was closed =
(duplicate). The duplicate (ID: 7275187 ) radar entry is not viewable by =
me.

A workaround (also nasty...). Open the URL in Safari and Store the =
password. Therefore it is in the keychain. Quicktime X can now access =
the resource.

If you find another solution or here anything from apple.. please let me =
know.
