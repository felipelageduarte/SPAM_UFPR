dumb question: X client behind a firewall?Let's say you're behind a firewall and have a NAT address.
Is there any way to telnet to a linux box out there in the world
and set your DISPLAY in some way that you can create
xterms on your own screen?

She flew somewhere, far away
Undoing her hair, lying down, in her sleep
She becomes the wind.
