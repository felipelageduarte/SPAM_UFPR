That's simple.  The same thing that any beta project needs to improve.
Continuous
End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve
the
system.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is
testing
on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in
the
new version, thus slowing down the debugging process.

Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can
be quickly
looked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if
possible,
as well as any "captured" spam that generated the error(s).


Thank you, please drive through,
