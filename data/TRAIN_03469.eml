I may be a light debian user. 'Cause i simply use GNOME power manager as
battery tool, supposed to be the default power manager in GNOME. I think it
is kind of dull. I've found battery using up much more quickly under debian
than it under windows(yes, i'm using a dual-booting laptop).

So, is this just because i choosed a unsuitable tool? Or it has any other
reason. In the comparison mentioned above, I was doing some file work and/o=
r
running emacs
