A KDE contributor who is trying to help make KDE suitable for you. If
you do not appreciate that then I can just buzz right off, no hard

debian-kde@lists.debian.org, I'm subscribed to both.

Orders? I asked what problems you have, so that I can fix them. You
don't even have to file a bug, I was willing to do that for you. Go
look at the bugs that I've posted in reply to other peoples' issues.
Go look at who is filing them. Oh, sorry, you might take that as an
order and get offended.
