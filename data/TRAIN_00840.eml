This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.
