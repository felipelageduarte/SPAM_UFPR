I've used dd to push a copy of a working system onto larger drives in the
past. So my misuse of the term "migrate" is me actually doing a copy of the
working system to a new, larger device and then zap the original.

I'd hoped there was a block by block way to do it so I didn't have to set
up the partitions & filesystems ahead of time but I suppose that part won't
be too painful.

The system is relatively idle during these types of surgeries because I
boot from a live CD so the data on disk isn't churning.

Thanks to all who responded, it gave me a lot to consider for this type of
project. Like doing proper diffs afterwards to make sure everything landed
on the new device properly!
