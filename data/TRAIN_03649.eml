Re: PDF is blocked for printing, etc. OK for acroread (it behaves
 as expected), but KPDF allows me to print it, even if it is protected!

Except that most technical people would probably rather hammer a nail
through their forehead than go through the pain of suing someone and
dealing with the legal system, the paper work, the time involved ...

So looking for a technical solution, even one that requires an
enormous amount of development time, makes sense.  Maybe the
development time is actually a bonus, if you're interested in that
sort of tinkering already.

All of that being said - this entire thread is really a question of
security, and security is a process and an approach, not an end result.
There is no such thing as a 100% secure system that is also useful, in
the same way that there is no such thing as a 100% secure PDF that is
also useful.  So the real goal is to make the document "secure enough"
for one's purposes, while also making the document "usable enough" for
those purposes.  I think there have been a lot of good ideas on this
thread for managing that trade-off.
