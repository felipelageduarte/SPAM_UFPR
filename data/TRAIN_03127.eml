O.k. here is what I was looking for:

"Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and other OSs" all of them include their own 
licencing model, whatever it is (closed or open sourced), so I can use 
the software knowing beforehand what I can (or can't) do with it.

The licensing model of Flash was (very) unclear for me, that is what I 
meant to say. And heck, it was recently "opened" (2008?) so it's a 
evolving license that could "dissolve" into something worse.

Do not get me wrong, I'm only saying that if I were a developer, I would 
have many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works.
