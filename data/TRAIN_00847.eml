Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there 
first?

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared 
whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only 
spam I see in my inbox now.
