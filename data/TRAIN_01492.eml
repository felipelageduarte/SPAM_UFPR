If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage
for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would 
prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1% 
of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't 
be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair 
amount of fake users too.

Now, for the "fair amount of fake users", spammers don't have access to 
many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming 
from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class 
C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is 
going on. This could also trigger alarms.

As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any
thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may 
be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from 
the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger 
for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL 
could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone 
line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class 
C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have 
several connections at different locations, but that increases their 
cost and so is not so much interesting.
