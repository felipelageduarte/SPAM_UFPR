Um yeah, I suppose that'd be useful info...  Western France, La Rochelle
area.  Test as in test with Linux or just turn on and see that it works?

Bathroom upstairs, Computer desk downstairs, got dripped into, started

I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  Given
that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along
with another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into
