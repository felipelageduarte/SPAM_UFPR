Holidays for freshrpms.net :-)Hi all,

I'll be leaving this evening until next Monday, with no access to
whatsoever to a single computer until then, woohoo, real holidays! :-)

So don't be worried if there's a new release of <insert your favorite
freshrpms package here> and that it's not updated quickly despite your many
requests to the list ;-)

Before going, I did repackage the latest hackedbox and lbreakout2 that both
came out today.

Have fun! (I will!! ;-))
Matthias
