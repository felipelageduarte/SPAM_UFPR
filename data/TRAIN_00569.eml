root@debian:/home/stuckey# mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0/

mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so

root@debian:/home/stuckey#

root@debian:/dev# ls -al cdrom
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2010-04-25 20:05 cdrom -> sr0
