No - that is the problem!!  I loved KDE 3.5.x and have become quite slick with 
it.  KDE 4 is different.  I don't like it.  If I have to, in effect, change 
DE, and go through the learning curve again, there is no reason why it would 
have to be to KDE 4.  When the time comes that I cannot sensibly go on using 
KDE 3, I shall chose where I go next on the basis of what the options are 
looking like at the time.  I can see little liklihood that that choice will 
be KDE 4.  I may even switch to a window manager without a DE, and chose 
other ways of working, if that is the only way that I can avoid the glitz 
that is now all the rage.

How things look is very important to me.  I have problems with my eyes, and 
how a thing looks can influence whether I can work on a thing for one minute, 
ten minutes or an hour.

I have no problem with other people liking and wanting to use KDE 4.  I have a 
problem with their, in some cases, not allowing me the freedom _not_ to use 
it.  And I personally shall mourn the passing of KDE 3.
