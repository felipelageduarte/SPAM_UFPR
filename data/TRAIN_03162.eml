San Francisco caffeine tourURL: http://boingboing.net/#85481649

Javawalk is a coffee-oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. 

    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!
