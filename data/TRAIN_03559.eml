What I read was that there is a difference between how Java 6 and Java 5 =
handle glyph rendering. That means that there is a not backward =
compatible modification in Java 6 that triggers that problem. No need to =
have a BS in computer science to parse that.

And glyph rendering affects performance. And it is likely that other =
modifications in Java 6 similarly affect performance for other areas. =
Are you being a troll ?
