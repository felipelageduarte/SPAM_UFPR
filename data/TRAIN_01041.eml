I don't want to reinstate this discussion, but I just found sth which I haven't heard/read about 
before, which might help you (haven't tried it myself).

I just started the Akonadi Tray utility, then right-clicked on the tray icon and chose Configure...
The second tab, labelled "Akonadi Server Configuration" has a setting for Database driver, which 
allows you to choose between MySQL and ... PostgreSQL
With PostgreSQL selected, you can specify your database settings.

Maybe that helps.
