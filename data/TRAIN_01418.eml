Sidekick's browser blowsURL: http://boingboing.net/#85524549
Date: Not supplied

Anil Dash discovers that the T-Mobile Sidekick's web-browser is pretty 
arbitrary in which pages it will load and which pages it will throw up its 
hands at: 

    So I decided I was going to modify my page to conform to your browser's 
    idiocy. I went looking for technical docs on what you do to mangle web 
    pages. None. I went looking for a desktop emulator that I could run to 
    simulate your device on my computer. None. I went looking to see an 
    acknowledgement of the shortcomings of your device, indicating that the 
    situation would be improved. None.
