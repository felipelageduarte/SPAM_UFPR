What about a java launcher stub. Use Runtime exec to launch a java  
process. I think this is what the Apache common launcher project code  
amounts to. It is based on the Tomcat or some such product launcher  
code and uses a ant task approach but I think in the end just amounts  
to Runtime exec'd java. Assuming you can decide at Runtime what  
parameters you want to use.
