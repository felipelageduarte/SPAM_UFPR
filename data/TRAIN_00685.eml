The situation between Flash and Java isn't even comparable.

Java is open and useful, Flash is neither.

Java still shares the the lowest-common-denominator cross-platform =
weakness/strength (depending on perspective), which Apple may not want =
to promote on the iPhone, because, let's face it, there are so many =
patents on the iPhone that lots of that stuff can't be done in a =
cross-platform way, because other platforms won't be allowed to have the =
same functionality.
So cross-platform code on the iPhone/iPod/iPad just doesn't make sense. =
The market is big enough that if their product sell on these devices, =
the developers can afford to make a first-class citizen native app =
rather than being lazy and trying to write the same things for =
deployment everywhere.

Nothing stops anyone from using a portable code engine (e.g. C code or =
Java compiled to C) and then put a native Cocoa Touch GUI on it.

Flash from the get-go was designed to captivate a part of the internet =
and make it privately owned, just like Silverlight and a slew of other =
efforts, too. Flash and Frames are the bane of the web. Can't properly =
search, bookmark, print, copy&paste, etc. any of these. May they die a =
quick, painful death, they caused enough suffering for users and web =
developers alike.

Having a several dozen web pages open sucks the life out of the fastest =
machines, because of all the flash. That I only could suspect until 10.6 =
put plug-ins in subprocesses. The relative CPU load between all of =
Safari vs. the Flash plug-in speaks volumes.

As much as I have to criticize about the closed nature/censorship of the =
AppStore ecosystem, I'm THRILLED that Apple isn't bending. I hope Apple =
can give the blow of death to Flash, which has been more than an =
annoyance for many years. I can't wait until that's a chapter in =
computing HISTORY. Bravo Jobs&Co.!!!

I also support his statement about Adobe being lazy. No version of any =
Macromedia/Adobe Suite has ever run properly on any machine that has a =
case-sensitvive root file system. If software is properly written, it =
shouldn't even notice a difference, and the only parties which have to =
be aware of the difference are users that copy files in a mixed file =
system environment, or writers of backup/file-management software (where =
2 files on one file system might map to one file on another).

Only sloppy coding where paths are not #define-ed in one place but more =
or less accurately copy&paste-ed all over the code base causes issues =
with resource and path name mismatches when the software is installed on =
a case-sensitive file system. For a decade and several product cycles =
Adobe didn't fix that, even though there were many bug reports about the =
matter and even though Apple emphasized several times on various =
occasions at WWDC that developers shouldn't make any assumptions on the =
nature of the file system that the system is installed.

Adobe didn't (want to) get it. They just wanted to continue milking =
their old pre-OS9 code base for as long as possible. I wish Apple would =
use some of their war chest to produce true competitors to Adobe's crap =
that are reasonably priced. Adobe charges up the wazoo, and didn't care =
to be a good platform citizen, and were it not for the 64-bit =
transition, they'd still ship old, buggy Carbon based code. Barf! I'm =
glad Jobs finally said it and broke with corporate politeness.=
