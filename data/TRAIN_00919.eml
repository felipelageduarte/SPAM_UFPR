This works fine; I do it all the time when testing hardware.

These days it becomes easier to have a bunch of USB ports than a
bunch of serial ports, so USB/serial converters are cheap and useful
and I've yet to find one that doesn't just work under Debian.

I used to use minicom, but lately I use "screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600"
or whatever.

Cheers,
Andy
