Well, WFM.

Do you have a log of the shutdown messages that appear on the console?  The=
y=20
might tell us why your filesystem is not getting cleanly re-mounted read-on=
ly.

Yes.  Many, many more times.  A filesystem that can't grow is beyond useles=
s=20
for me.  Luckily btrfs support growing and shrinking and it can do both whi=
le=20
mounted.  On-line shrinking is a trick I couldn't get reiser3 to perform.

Well, I will still have to have a "partition" for GRUB to embed stage 1.5 i=
f I=20
go with GPT.  However, it won't contain files per se.  I like having as muc=
h=20
as possible on LVM because it makes it easier to migrate to new storage med=
ia=20
and retire the old media.
