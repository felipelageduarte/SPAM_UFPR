Lately, a fairly large % of the spam I've been getting has been coming from
spam systems that forge my own address as the "from" address... Those spam
messages would get through any whitelist I set up (especially since I email
stuff to myself all the time).  If whitelists become more popular, I
imagine spammers will resort to doing that for the majority of their spams,
making whitelists less helpful.

Plus, I'm still not sure how I feel about whitelists.  I don't think I'm so
special that people should need to fill out a special form just to send me
email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
(especially those with multiple email addresses...).
