Thanks!

In the past I tried "lilo -u /dev/hda" and it wouldn't work -- an
original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.

Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.
