that was before my time.  all unix systems i've used didn't allow hard
links to directories, or if they did they were restricted to root.
the reason why is because you could cause infinite loops in the kernel -
usually a bad place for infinite loops.

to make them consistent with hard links.

let's call these super-soft-links.  ln -ss

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % mv floyd foo
    % ls -i foo
    222 foo

and now bar no longer points to foo.

    % ln -ss foo bar
    % ls -i foo
    111 foo
    % rm foo
    % touch floyd
    % ls -i floyd
    111 floyd

the fs would need to maintain a table of links going the other direction.
so when the move command unlinks foo in the first example, it could
check the table and mark that bar is now disconnected.  the same would
be true for the second example - and even more important since bar points
to floyd if no table is consulted.

and this all fails to handle nfs mounted file systems or filesystems
that have dynamic inodes (the fat fs's and reiser lacks inodes i think).
