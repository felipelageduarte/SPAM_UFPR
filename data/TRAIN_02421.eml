Re: KDE 4.4.3 in unstableI don't get what you're trying to accomplish.

So you don't like the dependency to Akonadi? Too bad. As can be read on many places, Akonadi is 
there to stay. And as you mentioned in another post, the dependency to Akonadi has been in place for 
a while now (Korganizer and KAddressBook since 4.2). So there's no way in hell you're going to have 
(upstream) support for an Akonadi-less PIM.

Or don't you like the Akonadi dependency to mysql-server? Well, it's not the full mysqld package 
anymore, but the dependency is to mysql-server-core(-5.1) (see #548419).
SQLite has been found inappropriate since it lacks proper transaction support.
PostgreSQL is apparently capable of providing the proper features and Tobias Koenig has made Akonadi 
working with PostgreSQL since the end of last year (http://tokoe-kde.blogspot.com/2009/12/akonadi-
and-postgresql.html). That patch was committed to trunk at that time, but apparently didn't make 
into SC 4.4 (?).
So if you want to use PostgreSQL, your best bet would be to port/base that patch on 4.4.

Yeah right, let's get a combination of 4.3 and 4.4 (and 4.2?) into stable, that surely must be 
preferable. And good luck getting any upstream support for bugs resulting from that.

As Ana indicated the freeze won't wait for SC 4.5, so better make the best out of 4.4.
If you want the freeze to wait for 4.5, better try to convince the release team. Good luck.
