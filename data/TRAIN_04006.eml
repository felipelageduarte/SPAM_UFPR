  | Ever tried to get MH to *not* have a 'pseq' sequence?

Hmm - I've been using MH for a long time (since well before there were
sequences) and I don't think I've ever seen a "pseq" ...

I'm guessing that that's the sequence that you have "pick" create
As I recall it, it has no default sequence name, so the sequence names
that people use will tend to vary from person to person won't they
(except as MH configurations move around institutions by osmosis).

I've always used "sel" for that purpose.

I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
very general.   Even "unseen" can be changed (fortunately that one
is easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,
os just uses "unseen" I haven't bothered to find out).
