Port San Luis, California
September 05, 2002

A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.

Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
off Port San Luis.

Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.

Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.

Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat.
