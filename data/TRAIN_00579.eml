As far as I know, the proper way to disable a service is to change the=20
Sxy link in Kxy for the respective runlevel (this can also be done with=20
any of the available runlevel editors, like sysv-rc-conf).

Removing all Sxy symlinks will result in them being recreated on the=20
next upgrade (as you have experienced).

You can also make changes to the init.d script, but I'm not sure which=20
ones will be detected by dpkg. Textual changes will, but don't know=20
about removing the execute bit or the like.
