I'm curious.  When I install MySQL on a Lenny server it thereafter
automatically starts the global /var/lib/mysql MySQL server at boot time.

I thought Akonadi was intended to use a private MySQL server process
running in each users' home directory and started as needed.  (Maybe
I misunderstood.)

Does installing KDE cause a global /var/lib/mysql MySQL server to run on
each workstation, even when nobody is logged in?
