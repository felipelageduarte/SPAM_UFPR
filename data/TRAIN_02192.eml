Hi,

I noticed on many computers with Debian, whatever the kernel (2.6.xx, xx
>=3D 26), that, once ``too much'' tabs have been opened, Firefox/Icewease=
l
becomes sluggish, slower and slower, and often stalls after some time. I
also noticed that, when becoming more and more sluggish, it takes more
and more RAM, even when all the pages are completely loaded. Why? Am I
the only person who's experiencing this? Is there an objective
explanation to this?
