Having recently checked out both of these, for a selection of
books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

The books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)

I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.

Cheers,
Dave.
