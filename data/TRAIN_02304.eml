I just opened a new Writer 3.2.0-9+b1 document then selected the 
"title image" http://i.space.com/images/080702-voyager-01.jpg from 
http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/nasa-tracking-voyager2-problem-100506.html 
and pasted it into the document.

No errors, hangs or "quits".

An example would help.

I selected all of the Early life section, copied it to the clipboard 
with Edit->Copy then bounced over to a new Writer document and 
pasted it with Edit->Paste.  No problems whatsoever.
