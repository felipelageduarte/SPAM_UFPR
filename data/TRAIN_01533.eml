Great, that is very nice of you.

Good! Your opinion of what is spam is unreliable, and therefore, I don't
*want* to trust you. IMHO, that is exactly the case that the trust system is
supposed to sort out. People who incorrectly submit non-spam bulk mail to
razor.

Then those lots of people are unreliable, and therefore will all have
minimal trust, but the people with a decent reliability and therefore trust
level will help us all...

IMHO, due to the number of messages you are sending, and the way you are
discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.

Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....

Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid "Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out" etc...

Just my $1 worth...

Adam
