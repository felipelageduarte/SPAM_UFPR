I can tell you how I do it - there may be other ways.

I set up a "compose" key through the GNOME settings: 
System -> Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layout Tab -> Layout Options button

>From there you can set up a key to be the "compose" key in the "Compose
Key position" section. I use "Caps Lock" since I do not use that key
otherwise, but you can choose any of the keys available.

Once you have a compose key defined you can enter the power of two
character by typing: <compose> ^ 2

This is three separate key presses. You do not hold down the compose
key.
