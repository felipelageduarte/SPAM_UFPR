Hi, I have an Asus "sabertooth" 55i (socket LGA1156) with the same 
Realtek lan chip (rev03 here), no problem.
The motherboard is overpriced due to it's marketing hype regarding 
"military" grade components and "Ceramix" coated heatsinks , but 
otherwise it's working great, and very cool too with an Intel Core i7. 
Layout is good for my needs, ample space for large video card without 
blocking any sata port. Bundle is limited to bare minimum (esata/usb 
bracket and a few cables). Used for video processing mainly, occasional 
kernel compilations, virtualbox vm and the occasional game.Works with 
Squeeze amd64 with stock kernel (minor sound glitches with on-board 
chip) and currently 2.6.33.2 (100% functional), suspend works too.
