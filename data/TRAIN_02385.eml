Re: [SAdev] [Bug 584] New: More general rule cleanupThanks Dan. And the changes were very clever. Some of his rule changes 
actually did make thing more readable and he is highly skilled at 
regular expressions.  I have found that readability and 
understandability is important in maintaining code. I think in a group 
project that it's more important.
