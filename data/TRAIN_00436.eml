The fact is that I didn't perform any pasting: even running "gpg
--verify" directly on the message file fails (Sylpheed stores e-mail
messages in MH format, hence each message is on a separate file).

I received the message encoded as quoted-printable: maybe something in
the middle performed some re-encoding, that broke the signature?

However, that does not explain why Mutt is able to correctly verify
the signature...
Damn Mutt, always one step beyond!  ;-)

Wouldn't we be better off using PGP/MIME signed messages (RFC 2015)
in order to avoid encoding issues?
As far as I've heard, clear-signed e-mail messages are deprecated precisely
because of this kind of signature breakages, due to possible re-encoding.

Any thoughts?
