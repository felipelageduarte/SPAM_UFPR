Actually the more I think about it, the more I realise that I would rather have 
some kind of full blooded monitoring app which lets me see stats (or even charts 
like ntop) of internet speed over the week, although I bet that is just dreaming.

I read one thread somewhere out there about apps like cacti, zenoss and 
groundwork - if you know anything about such packages, then you know more about 
them than me: is this kind of package remotely suitable or am I barking up the 
wrong tree?
