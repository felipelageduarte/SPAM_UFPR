I checked. Union is described in the Ritchie, Johnson, Lesk, and
Kernighan, The C Programming Language, in Bell System Technical
Journal of JULY-AUGUST 1978, p. 1991. At that time the Bell System had
C compilers running on PDP-11, Honeywell 6000, IBM System/370, and
Interdata 8/32.  You're right. >20years.
