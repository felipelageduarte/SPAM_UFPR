It's possible, but I would generally do it for clarity.  I like using the=20
types of variables/arguments as documentation, so I would store any data wh=
ere=20
the real type was unknown in the union.  Then access it though a "struct=20
cms_label *" or "struct volume_label *" one I had determined the correct ty=
pe.

Since C unions are not tagged, a C union is the same size as it's largest=20
member.  (NB: Not really sure how __attribute__((__packed__)) changes thing=
s,=20
if at all; it's possible you need it on the union to prevent padding from=20
being added after the space occupied by the largest member.)

Initialization optional, but recommended.

Since you are declaring a pointer to a structure, and not declaring an obje=
ct=20
with type "struct cms_label", no space will be allocated for a cms_label.

Make your declaration a definition and that'll be handled.  (Declarations a=
nd=20
definitions look very similar for non-function types; the code given above =
is=20
actually a definition if it is not within a struct/union type.)

struct cms_label *cms_ptr;

/* Load data into vl */
/* Determine that the data is actually a cms_label */
cms_ptr =3D (void *) &vl;

Or, in your specific case, you should be able to do something like:

struct cms_label *cms_ptr =3D (void *) disk_specific->anchor->vlabel;

Since you are already dealing with a "struct volume_label *", there's no ne=
ed=20
for the address-of operator (&).

cms_ptr->label_id; /* Or any other member. */

Examples above good?  Please let me know if I can provide further assistanc=
e.
