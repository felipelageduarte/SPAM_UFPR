Prob. w/ install/uninstallhey i have a problem:
i have a rpms that i have installed that i want to uninstall, i do it
like so:
rpm -e [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package not installed, so i install it like
so:
rpm -i [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package already installed, so i force it to
install like so:
rpm -i --force [rpm package]
this installs it and then i try to uninstall it again and it still
gives me the same error: package not installed.
 
How can i get it to recognize that the package is indeed installed it,
and/or get it to unstall it?
 
Thanx in advance,
Brian French
