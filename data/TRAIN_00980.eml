I'll retry, but I think I was already on early 4.4 packages already.  Not=20

This one certainly is not fixed in 4.4.  On a big database inherited from=20
earlier strigi, enabling strigi and then disabling strigi and nepomuk=20
alltogether, the database is still there.  (To be precise: the database=20
*was* still there.  rm -rf is your friend.)
