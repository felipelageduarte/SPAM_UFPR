To be more precise, automatic reporting is a Good Thing only if there's
/zero/ possibility of reporting positives falsely (or as close to zero
as makes no difference in the end).

cmeclax's example (which incidentally points out a major vulnerability
of auto-reporting trollboxes) basically says "I'll blindly report as
spam whatever some other user(s) have reported as spam".  That "blindly"
part undermines the very purpose of Razor, so I too hope that:
