$ grep forcefsck /etc/init.d/*
/etc/init.d/checkfs.sh:		if [ -f /forcefsck ] || grep -s -w -i "forcefsck" =
/proc/cmdline
/etc/init.d/checkfs.sh:	rm -f /fastboot /forcefsck 2>/dev/null
/etc/init.d/checkroot.sh:		if [ -f /forcefsck ] || grep -s -w -i "forcefsck=
" /proc/cmdline

Both scripts don't seem generic enough to me. Fscking for XFS should=20
work as long as you have the relevant tools installed.
