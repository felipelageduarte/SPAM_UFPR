Anolther sequence related tracebackJust got this ... I was just reading mail, but in a very dark
room, where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from
the (laptop) screen.   I think I put my fingers on the wrong keys.
(I mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh).

This is from today's cvs (the fixes for the problems I mentioned
yesterday are included) - I eventually managed to contact the cvs
server.

expected integer but got ""

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the
"colours from the ftoc" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.
