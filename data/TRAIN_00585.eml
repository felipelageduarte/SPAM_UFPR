Re: Snow Leopard refresh problemsYes, I fixed those issue with some silly workarounds only. The repaint 
methods are not producing any fruitful results.

These are the options I used:
1. In some cases, resizing the frame solved the issue.
2. In few cases, changed the location of one of the component present inside 
the frame and then relocating the same component to its original position at 
the end of the method solved the problem.
3. In one case, removed the component and added the same component to the 
frame solved the issue.

Another typical point to note is, I could not find a single common solution 
for all the above 3 cases.

hello,

did you find any workarounds?
Are some methods of asking for a repaint more reliable than others?

regards,
