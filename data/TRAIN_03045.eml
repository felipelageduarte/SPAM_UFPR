Then this may be 6 months or more since my guess after 3 beta releases is
that the freeze on package versions for inclusion in the next stable
release (n+1) has already happened, thus you'll have to wait at least for
Red Hat Linux... n+2 :-)

This is why (if it doesn't break anything), I'll maybe release recent
aspell packages. But to be sure I'll need to do some testing ;-)
