According to http://packages.debian.org/chromium-browser [1] it is only=20
available in sid/unstable. backports.org usually carries newer versions=20
of packages compiled for stable, but the policy is to have only packages=20
=66rom testing.

[1] I could have told you the same with
'apt-cache policy chromium-browser', but I do have sources for all three=20
releases ;)

You could also try to backport it yourself or just compile from source. =20
The upstream provided debs I don't like, because of the way they handle=20
updates.
