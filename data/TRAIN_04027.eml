Re: Benjamin Wallace HigginsCongratulations!!

A few observations:

All children are different and will generally route around whatever 
technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child.

Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done.

Don't overprotect. I always called this "First Baby Syndrome". A 
neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, 
probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was 
far too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the 
hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm 
not there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of 
course.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying 
to do 5ft. half pipes on speed skates with my 10 year old daughter.
