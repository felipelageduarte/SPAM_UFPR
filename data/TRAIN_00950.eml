Hence the qualifier 'current'.

The tacit acknowledgement and self-limiting you speak of is not a given
or a function of 'sophistication' but is primarily a feature of
(current) Western Civilization.  Of course, 'sophisticated' and 'Western
Civilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.  But it need not be so.

And sometimes the religious component is a façade for an equally
dangerous ethnic affiliation.  Hindu extremism isn't about the Hindu
religious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic
identity and identity politics on.

Muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.

Yep, all because the Scots ate oats and starved their Irish out long
ago, while the English preferred wheat and that doesn't grow so well in
Ireland.  That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as
Irish.

Oh, I think we are in a war with wide aspects of the Muslim religion.  I
know it is there, but it just might not be appropriate to admit it
publicly.

I didn't say this was a *good* thing.  With the exception of ethnic
restaurants, I can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled
'multi-cultural'.

I'm sure I wasn't.
