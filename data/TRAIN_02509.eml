Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have 
as well.

The enabling change to "ftoption.h" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before 
building.  Take a look at "freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch" from the 
SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.

So if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.
