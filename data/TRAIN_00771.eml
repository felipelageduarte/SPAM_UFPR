[Spambayes] Maybe change X-Spam-Disposition to something else...
I actually like Neale's X-Spam-Disposition header, I just wonder if maybe we
should choose something with a different prefix than "X-Spam-" so that
people don't confuse it with SpamAssassin, all of whose headers begin with
that prefix.

Also, some sort of version information would be useful.  Perhaps the CVS
version number for the classifier module could be tacked on.
