Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
implications, unless it's just BS.

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...

Mmmmmmmmmmm, machine code, never a good idea ;)
