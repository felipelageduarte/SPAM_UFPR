The unexpected forced downgrade from KDE 3.5 to 4 in Sid actually
ended up being a good thing for me. (the loss of the ability to have a
different background for each desktop was a KDE showstopper.  So the
forced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other
desktop environments.   And had that not happened, I would not be
using Enlightenment on all my Linux boxes today.  I have become quite
enamored with Enlightenment, and now see no need whatsoever to go back
to KDE or switch to Gnome.

Granted, I will happily use various KDE and Gnome based tools if
needed.  That is no big deal.  But E (with the Steampunk theme)  is
now my environment of choice.  :)  Only drawback so far I have
encountered is the inability to change the background color on the
desktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen.  It
can be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background, but I
think I can get used to it.
