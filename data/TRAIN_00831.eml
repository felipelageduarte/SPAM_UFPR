I have a working apt 0.5.4cnc7 package for Red Hat Linux 8.0. It will be
available at the same second the distribution will, and so will a complete
apt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for Red
Hat Linux 8.0.

I didn't want to say all this before Monday, but as the new release already
leaked from many places, and official statements made about it, it
shouldn't be a big deal :-/

I'll keep you all posted on Monday! They'll even be a big apt-related
surprise! ;-))))
