You Only THINK You're U.S. Citizen!!                                                              8403ZmSX2-110-12<html><H3><B>You only <I><font color=red>THINK</font> </font> you're a
<font color=blue>U.S. citizen!!</font><P>

If you were born in <font color=green>Washington D.C., Puerto Rico,<BR>
Guam, the Virgin Islands</font> or some other <font 
color=green>U.S.<BR>
possession</font>; you're right and I'm wrong.<P>

<I>BUT</I> - - If you were born in one of the 50 united<BR>
States of America, you <font color=blue>ARE NOT</font> a U.S. 
citizen.<BR>

Rather, you are a <font color=red>Citizen </font> of <font
color=green>Idaho, Ohio, Maine,</font><BR>
etc.; the <font color=green>state of the Union</font> in which you were
<font color=red><I><U>BORN!</U></I></font><P>

This simple reality holds serious benefits for you!<P>

Since you <font color=red>ARE NOT</font> a "federal" citizen, you 
owe<BR>
<font color=blue><I><U>NO federal income taxes</U></I></font>.  The IRS
can only demand<BR>
income tax payments from <U>3 kinds of citizens:</U><P>

1. Those who are <font color=blue>citizens of the U.S.</font>!<BR>
2. Anyone who receives <font color=blue>"income" from a U.S.
source</font><BR>
(and wait until you find out what <font color=blue>"income"</font> really
is!).<BR>
3. Any Citizen of one of the 50 united States of America<BR>
who <font color=blue>VOLUNTEERS</font> to pay it!<P>

Believe it or not, - - When you sign an IRS W4 form for<BR>
your "employer" you have entered into a "hidden"<BR>
contract and have <font color=red>VOLUNTEERED</font> to pay!<P>

Our web site is <I>FILLED</I> with <font color=blue>educational and
eye<BR>
opening information</font> on how you've been <I><U>tricked</U></I>
into<BR>
this - AND how  you can <font color=red>free yourself</font> from the
treachery.<P>
