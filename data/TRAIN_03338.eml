I know nothing about Citrix client O:-), but found this forum thread:

***
french keyboard layout Problem using german characters  
http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=252710&tstart=0
***

Using the same client version (v11) and having a same (similar?) issue. 
The only difference is that the user seems to be using a windows version 
of the Citrix client.

Have you checked if there is a newer version of the Citrix client? :-?

Also, in this¹ FAQ says:

***
Incorrect keystrokes are displayed when I use the keyboard

If you are using a non-English language keyboard, the screen display may 
not match the keyboard input. In this case, you should specify the 
keyboard type and layout that you are using. For more information about 
specifying keyboards, see Configuring Keyboard Options, Alert Sounds, and 
Digital Dictation Support.
