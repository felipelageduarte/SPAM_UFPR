Some are included in the tarball provided by the Linux kernel team, which i=
s=20
distributed under the GPLv2.  In particular, I am thinking of the iwl3945=20
firmware that is required to run my wireless card.

It doesn't matter what upstream wants to call source code.  The GPL(v2)=20
defines it as the preferred form for making modifications.  (GPLv2, section=
=20
3.)  It is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor (or=20
equivalent).  Most likely it is C source for a freestanding (non-hosted)=20
environment with some manufacturer-specific libraries, but it could also be=
 in=20
some manufacturer-specific assembly code.  Either form would be better for=
=20
making modifications than a binary blob.
