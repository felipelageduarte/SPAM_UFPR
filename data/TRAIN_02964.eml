As others have mentioned, rgw command-line parameter $1 probably has a
'/' in it.

A simple workaround is to use a different character as the separator.
That is: *if* you can assume that variable will not contain the
character '|', you can use:

  sed -e "s|PLACEHOLDER1|$1|' -e "s|PLACEHOLDER2|$2|" < input > output

You can use some other characters there as well. See sed(1).
