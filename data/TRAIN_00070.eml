xine cannot play DVDs - "liba52: a52_block error"Since libdvdcss-1.2.0, I have been unable to play DVDs using ogle, xine,
vlc, or mplayer.  They all show a scrambled picture with (VERY) choppy
audio.  When I run xine I see tons of these in the console: 

liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
audio_out: inserting 5859 0-frames to fill a gap of 10989 pts
metronom: audio jump
liba52: a52_block error

Has anyone seen this before and know how to fix it?  Or should I file a
bug report?  

Thanks for your help.  

- Jon
