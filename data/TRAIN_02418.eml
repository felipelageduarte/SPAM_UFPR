Not so odd, this issue came up several weeks ago (with no real
resolution).

Everything else :)  I can't even mark text in an exmh message window
and then paste it into a terminal window, the cut buffer seems to be
completely empty (and its previous contents are no longer there
either).

  BTW: talking of spring downunder... I'm in Queensland.  It almost
  feels like early summer already (winters here are dry and warm,
  much better than cold wet miserable Melbourne :-)  Despite some
  recent rain (first in months), we are already into a drought, with
  an El-Nino on the way it is only going to get worse...  (the last
  one in the 90s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
  aussie).

Cheers
