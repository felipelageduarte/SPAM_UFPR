Mainly they were a bunch of rich people (the white/old/male is irrelivant
but how it happened to be at the time) that didnt want to pay their taxes to
da man er... king. So they had a revolution and formed a no-tax zone,
leading to a very fast growing economy and dreams for all - amazing what
an economy without 40% of everything disappearing to taxes. It was a great
many years before their were federal taxes in the US.

Now we give rich men who dont want to pay any taxes corporations to run,
with enough writeoffs and loopholes that they dont have to pay any :)
