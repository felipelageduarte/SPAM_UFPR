This comprehensive LTCI policy review compares over 40 major companies
in 17 benefit and ratings/asset categories and includes a premium
comparison for a 60 year old couple.

Over 210 policies are covered in this semi-annual publication. This is
the oldest LTC policy comparison in the nation and is a valuable tool
for any agent selling LTC insurance today.

(Older generation policies are kept after new policies are introduced
because agents encounter the older policies in the field.)

The CD-ROM version allows you to compare up to three companies at a time
in any of the 17 categories. You'll also receive a spreadsheet version
to take with you all the time.
