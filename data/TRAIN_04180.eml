Java Web Start Offline ProblemsIn recent Java versions, there is a regression that prevents Java Web =
Start applications from launching if there is no internet connection, =
even if they have <offline-allowed/> attribute.  Launching without an =
internet connection causes the application to "hang".  This is a serious =
problem for us, since many of our users move between having an internet =
connection and not having an internet connection - we have lots of =
unhappy customers.

I believe that at least part of the problem is this Oracle bug: =
<http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=3D6911785> which =
claims will be fixed in 1.6.0_20.  (There also seem to be other bugs =
because launching without an internet connection still takes way too =
long even with the developer preview of 1.6.0_20 on Windows7 - but at =
least it does launch.)

Has anyone figured out a workaround for this problem?  Any suggestions?

thanks, Nick=
