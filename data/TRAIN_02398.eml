How hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity.  In 
Mississippi they have lots of humidity, in the Southwest, we don't.

As I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F. 
than home (Santa Fe) does at 90.

Perhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it 
get's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp 
it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert 
they'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.

No, I'm not maligning Mississippi.  I had a great time passing through last 
year on vacation.
