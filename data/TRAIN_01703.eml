[Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so
I thought I'd give it a shot.  I also run SpamAssassin so I'd like to
integrate the two.

I'm not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I'd
shoot the message here first

With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method "log" on
unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm
line 211, <STDIN> line 75.

Any ideas?  razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

Thanks,
-Dave
