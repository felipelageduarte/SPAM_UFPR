Battery monitor tools?
I'm looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my=20
Ubuntu laptop. I'm aware that there's the "Power History" tool, but it=20
doesn't seem to do what I'm after. I'll explain....

A couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for=20
estimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or =

discharged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would=20
constantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still =

had, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The=20
tool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge...=20
/but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the=20
battery's reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had=20
80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had=20
just 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the=20
battery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was=20
reporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too=20
optimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the=20
tool was learning what "80%" /really/ meant to that battery.

It also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery=20
drains at different rates depending upon what you're doing with your=20
laptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some=20
text on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you "best case"=20
and "worst case" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to=20
charge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of =

battery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So,=20
you'd open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you'd see three=20
lines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you're=20
currently at.

So, two questions:
1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux=20
forum but, as long as I'm describing the tool, I figured I'd ask. It's=20
not the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but=20
now I can't find it anywhere).
2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there=20
some way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff?
