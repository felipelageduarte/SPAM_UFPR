Argh!! I did upgrade to acroreat 9.3.1 from multimedia unstable upon
these responses and the referenced article which was based upon 9.x.  I
even set a LID_LIBRARY_PATH variable in case it was not a typo.  It
still doesn't work.  Setting the command line debugging variable, I
found that it cannot find the PPD file.  Does it only work if the CUPS
server is running locally? In our case, we use a central CUPS server
running on a non-standard port.  This is reflected
in /etc/cups/client.conf.  How do we tell acroread where the printer
server and PPD files are? Thanks - John
