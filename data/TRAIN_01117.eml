Re: The case for spam
Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.
