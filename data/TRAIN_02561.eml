In my apt.conf reads:

--<snip>--
RPM
{
   // Leave list empty to disable
   AllowedDupPkgs {"^kernel$"; "kernel-smp"; "kernel-enterprise"; };
   HoldPkgs {"kernel-source"; "kernel-headers"; };
}
--</snip>--

If I understand this correctly, then only kernel-source and kernel-headers 
are held from being installed, but kernel will be installed, right?

Maybe I should test this on some vanilla system...
