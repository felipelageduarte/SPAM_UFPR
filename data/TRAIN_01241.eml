After changing my kernel with the above, the "MD subsystem" loads 
because now I get:

Assembling MD arrays...done (no arrays found in config file or 
automatically).

So it depends on one or more of those kernel configs, at least in 2.6.33.4.

Trouble is that years ago when I started compiling my own kernel, I did 
not start a file with 3 columns: date - function - reason for adding, so 
now I have a kernel that keeps getting bigger and I don't know 
specifically why the entries are there, other than in general, like the 
ones above.
