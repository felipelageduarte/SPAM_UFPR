Okay a couple of things, I thing we are talking similiar and dissimiliar
things.


turn on laptop - not connected to ext monitor
loads debian
starts gdm
login
connect to external monitor
use xrandr to move screen to ext monitor
close lid on laptop
use alt+ctrl+f1 to get to tty1

the ext monitor stays on the X screen and the laptop monitors goes to
the tty - but the lid is closed, I want to move the tty to the ext
monitor

hope that clears it up...
