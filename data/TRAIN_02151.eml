02   WordPress Blogs Hacked

      For the past two weeks we've been battling WordPress hacks and
attacks that have affected thousands of blogs. Fortunately, they
did not get UGNN. However they did get several other sites we
administer, and it's not a pretty sight. Network Solutions
was hacked twice in ten days, and they don't seem to be
able to stay ahead of the hackers.

03  iPad on a roll, good and bad

      iPad news continues with pro and con news -
Apple: iPad 3G Coming on April 30 -- but when a 100-year old
Apple fan writes poem about iPad, you know it's special.

Other news includes
* iPad gets an 'okay' from Microsoft's Bill Gates
* Will iPad cannibalize Mac sales?
* Apple iPad is illegal in Israel
* 26 Percent of Wired's Mobile Traffic Comes From the iPad
* man loses pinky finger during ipad snatching
... and a skeptic's review (plus several others.)

04  Phishers still find plenty of suckers

      Phishing doesn't stop ... it just changes its methods as
seen in this week's phishing update:
* 1.5 Million Facebook Accounts for Sale
* Porn sites top drive-by download list
* Twitter Phishing Scam
* Fake Ticket Sites
* Google Cyberattack
* Facebook virus causes headaches
* 'Phishing' Phone Calls
* Social Networking on Facebook Declared Unsafe
   -- and others

06  Dracula HD 1.0 for iPad

      Last Friday, Intelligenti Publishing, the developers of
Dracula HD have launched a first-of-its-kind application.
Thanks to a flexible custom development, Dracula HD presents
a realistic series of journal entries, letters and newspaper
clippings that reveal, piece by piece, Bram Stoker's Dracula.

The Apps visual presentation is beyond what has been possible
or released before, to take users to a new level of
book enjoyment in a mobile platform.

07  WeatherCal

      Our friends at Bare Bones software have a new product
called WeatherCal. With WeatherCal, you enter the city of
your choice and you get a 5 day weather forecast as a
calendar. This calendar is compatible with iCal.

08  txtDrop

      For a long time now, we have been told that the most expense
way to send data from one person to another was text messaging
on a cell phone. At 20 to 30 cents per message, it is
extremely expensive, but when you realize, you are
paying it coming and going, it would double the expense.

09  Free Mac Software

      I am not sure that you really can't live without these,
but I do love lists.

10  Mac OS X Secret Keystrokes

      This is a list of OS X Keystrokes taken from the book
'The Missing Manual Leopard.'

11  60-Seconds: Rush does it again

      Thursday, I got a phone call from a reader who remembered
an old 2003 article of mine in 60-Second Windows. The near
frantic voice on the line said "Fred, you've got to turn
on the radio right now ... "
Once again Rush Limbaugh proves a theory about the internet.

13  Note to readers: Books to give away

      UGNN has accumulated a mountain of books from various
publishers for review. Our samples room is full to the ceiling,
and we would rather find someone who can benefit from these
rather than just hauling to recycling. There are also way
too many to list. So if you're adventurous, and want to
pay the shipping, let us know topics you're passionate
about and we'll send books free.

Let me know.
