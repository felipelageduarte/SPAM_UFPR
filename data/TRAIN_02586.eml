There is NO x86_64's lightning package.
see 
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=lightning&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all&sourceid=mozilla-search

Instead of installing from apt, you can manually download thunderbird 
and sunbird's tar.gz from the website, and install ia32's runtime library.
