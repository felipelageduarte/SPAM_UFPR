Assuming you talk about this character: Â², which is Unicode U+00b2, or 
SUPERSCRIPT TWO, just map your keyboard to do that for you. For example 
for assigning the combination AltGr-2 (AltGr is the right-Alt, if not 
marked as such):

xmodmap -e "keycode 0x0B =  2 at 0x010000b2"

To automate this add that line in your .xsession or .xinitrc.
For many changes to the keyboard make your own .xmodmap file
and add xmodmap .xmodmap in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.
