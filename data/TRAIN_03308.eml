So here's the final report on the HD/ID party. As no less than TEN 
forkers pointed out, the invitation, while sent on Sunday 6/30, was only 
delivered ten days later on 7/9.

It got flagged as spam.

Yes, on a mailing list awash in crap -- and some it is even unsolicited 
commercial email, heavens! -- our trusty mailman filters captured and 
quarantined just two posts that week, one from me that was > 100K (the 
fat articles) and one that was bcc:d (the invite).

Now, it was a little difficult to recalibrate self-esteem, which as you 
can imagine was proportional to the two-digit attendance  -- in binary!

According to the George Washington documentary, I almost had as much 
alcohol on hand than he did -- Virginia tradition being to copiously 
lubricate each voter. Election day was a public festival day, and it 
cost poor George an average of SIXTY-FOUR shots of hard liquor PER VOTER 
that day...

So, herewith is the prize for most appropriate flame my delayed invite 
got:

One of our competitors added:

And there is no prize for guessing which cold, dark forks emitted these 
two plaints:

 From Whiny Dwarf:

Perhaps I should remind the latter gently that it was not in any way his 
fault. The universe *was* out to get him!

And finally, here's an object lesson for all ye of little faith to learn 
from my sins:

Yes, boys and girls, Mr. Assassin, like Mr. Lott, gets very annoyed if 
you call the Great American Shrine a... "boob tube"

PS. This is the obscure footnote where I actually hide the bits in this 
post. What we just encountered here is that an event-processing system 
with a 10-day RTT cannot be used to reliably handle events more often 
than once every 20 days. That's why I waited to reply. six bonus points 
to anyone who can prove this hunch of mine. Hint: try analyzing the 
problem in frequency-domain.
