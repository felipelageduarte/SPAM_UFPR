Hi,

Let's say that you have two internet connections at home, and
consequently two devices which link your computer to the Internet. How
can you manage, e.g. in Iceweasel/FF, to use one or the other? If you
have multiple downloads all the time, it might be an interesting thing
to split them among the diferent connections.
