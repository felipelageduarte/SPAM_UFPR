how to debug JNI in xcodeHi,

I have a jni program that crashes, but don't know how to use xcode to debug it.

Is it possible to start the Java code in xcode and debug the *.mm code
and if so how do I go about doing that?

Or do I have to start the program and then attach the debugger and if
so how do I do that?

David
