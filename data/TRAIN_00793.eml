Re: The GOv gets tough on Net Users.....er Pirates..
What are you trying to sell???? What is the Value???

Example...Does Pratchett sell paper bound by glue or does he sell stories?



Question...When I buy a book have I purchased the story? When I sell the
book does any of that revenue go to mr Pratchett?

What if I read the book and  give it to someone, who then reads it
and gives it  to someone who then reads it and gives it to
someones....(bookcrossing.com though with  more succesfull passings). Does
each reader send Mr Pratchett money?

Have Used Bookstores, Recorstores etc destroyed the system of book/record
economy?

AS to the resident sourpuss, in germany bitter may be better but here its
just plain stinkin thinkin.
