am i the only one who thinks this is like "friday night 80's" for ilug?
and here's an answer from 1989.  for those perceptive folks in the
audience you'll note that it makes no reference to a windows icons.

and here's one from 1984:

on a more serious note....  would unrm be nice?  yeah.  but people have
talked about unrm for nearly ***20*** years - and that's just what i
bothered to look up.  think about it.  in that time bsd has been freed
from at&t and then forked in four different directions, gcc, linux,
mozilla, gnome and kde have been written.  as has almost every bit
of the gnu project - including (sh|file)-utils.  and think about it,
have the gnu (sh|file)-utils developers ever met an option they didn't
implement if they could?  even /bin/true and /bin/false take arguments.

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obviously it's not a simple problem.
millions of lines of code, hundreds of projects, no unrm.  heck, the
hurd will probably release 1.0 before unrm shows up.
