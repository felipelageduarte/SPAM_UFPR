That is troublesome, probably to the point of actually being broken.  It's=
=20
likely that something "behind-the-scenes" in LVM is actually messing with t=
he=20
snapshot device even when it is not mounted and preventing the removal.

I'm fairly sure the snapshot device has to be updated whenever a write is d=
one=20
to a new LE in the original device, and it's possible *that* is causing the=
=20
problem.  I hope this issue gets some attention; I doubt it is a Debian-ism.

My guess on this one is one of two things:
1) Udev is taking a little while to unlink "secondary" names for the LVs th=
at=20
are being removed, and when lvm does its device scan it's hitting "missing"=
=20
devices.
2) LVM is using device names from its cache for devices that are no longer=
=20
present for its device scan and, again, hitting "missing" devices.

In either case I think the error messages are annoying, but not indicative =
of=20
a real problem.
