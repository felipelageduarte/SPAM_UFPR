Ok, some more nits: alsa-xmms doesn't work if I don't have
alsa-lib-devel installed, but xmms dies on startup telling me:

   Cannot load alsa library: libasound.so: cannot open shared object
   file: No such file or directory

libasound.so is part of alsa-lib-devel... if I install it, the ALSA XMMS
output plugins works fine.

I can't install the xine stuff, because xine-libs needs libGLcore.so.1,
which I can't find anywhere (NVidia stuff?  I have Radeon 7500...)
