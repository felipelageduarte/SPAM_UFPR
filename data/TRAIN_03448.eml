KMail from KDEPIM 4.3 did not require MySQL because it didn't require Akona=
di.
KMail from KDEPIM 4.4 does require MySQL because Akonadi form KDE SC 4.4=20
requires MySQL.
KMail from KDEPIM 4.5 might not require MySQL because Akonadi from KDE SC 4=
=2E5=20
might not require MySQL.

My concern is the KMail -> MySQL relationship.  There are quite a few ways =

fix that.  I think I'm going to focus my efforts on getting Akonadi/SQLite=

ready for a release that is compatible with KDE SC 4.4 but occurs before th=

freeze date, as well as documenting how to use it.
