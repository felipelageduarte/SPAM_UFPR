 Yes. Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and
Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages
(like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
to break out of.

 But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

 Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People
that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

 I don't care, to be honest.
