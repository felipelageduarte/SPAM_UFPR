Detecting a closed SSL connectionI've written my Apple Push Notification client code in Java (on my =
server). I open an SSL socket to Apple with a client-side cert, and push =
a stream of bytes.

If part of that stream is mal-formed, as I understand it, Apple closes =
their end of the connection. Also as I understand it, this is made =
evident to a C client because the number of bytes written to the socket =
is 0 (or less than was intended).

However, in Java, I'm finding no evidence at all that Apple has stopped =
accepting push notifications, except that I can see the last =
notification doesn't go through (I set up a test case with one good and =
one bad token. By changing the order, I can see it work or not work).

What do I need to do to detect this condition in Java? I tried checking =
that the connection is still open and not half-open after each token, =
but it always looks good.

TIA,
Rick
