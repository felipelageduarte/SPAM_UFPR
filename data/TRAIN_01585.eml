Of course, "umount, then remove" is the normal way to remove USB stick
(and any other storage). But as far as main idea of automounting is
"easy (un)plug" (in my opinion at least), we have little weird but
working principle "sync, then unplug, and udev will carry out
everything else". As I already said, it's really weirds, but it works.

But all you said made me hard thinking about the way I mount and
unmount my removable media. Maybe I should forget about sync and use
'umount /mnt/sd[a-z]' instead, or even write little script which will
ask me which device I want to unmount=E2=80=A6 Dunno. But thanks for sharin=
g
your thoughts with me!

P.S. Camale=C3=B3n, please forgive me for sending previous mail directly to
you, not to the list. I think it's time to drop GMail web interface
and switch back to local email client=E2=80=A6
