Automounting problems.I am running an up to date Lenny box with FVWM.  I do not run Gnome, or KDE.  I want to have removable devices, such as flash drives and mp3 players, automount.  I have read the mini How-To on automounting, but I still can't get it to work.

This is the relevant data:

$ cat /etc/auto.master

#
# $Id: auto.master,v 1.4 2005/01/04 14:36:54 raven Exp $
#
# Sample auto.master file
# This is an automounter map and it has the following format
# key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location
# For details of the format look at autofs(5).
#/misc  /etc/auto.misc --timeout=60
#/smb   /etc/auto.smb
#/misc  /etc/auto.misc
#/net   /etc/auto.net
/mnt    /etc/auto.mnt



$ cat /etc/auto.mnt
#
# $Id: auto.misc,v 1.2 2003/09/29 08:22:35 raven Exp $
#
# This is an automounter map and it has the following format
# key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location
# Details may be found in the autofs(5) manpage

#cd             -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev :/dev/cdrom

# the following entries are samples to pique your imagination
linux           -ro,soft,intr           ftp.example.org:/pub/linux
#boot           -fstype=ext2            :/dev/hda1
#floppy         -fstype=auto            :/dev/fd0
#floppy         -fstype=ext2            :/dev/fd0
#e2floppy       -fstype=ext2            :/dev/fd0
#jaz            -fstype=ext2            :/dev/sdc1
#removable      -fstype=ext2            :/dev/hdd
#pen            -fstype=auto            :/dev/sda1
mp3             -fstype=auto            UUID="7CE2-E7EA"
lexar           -fstype=vfat            LABEL="LEXAR MEDIA"



$ /etc/init.d/autofs status
Configured Mount Points:
------------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt

Active Mount Points:
--------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --pid-file=/var/run/autofs/_mnt.pid --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt


The last two lines in /etc/auto.mnt refer to the devices that I am trying to automount.  I would use UUID for lexar, but it is "0000-0000" and would conflict with other devices.  I unplugged the devices prior to updating the files, the replugged them, but they do not automount.  I made sure that there are no references to the files in /etc/fstab, but still no automounting.  I also tried reloading autofs and then replugging the devices.  Nothing.

What am I missing?

All help appreciated.
