Well, that doesn't help you reading your listing.

I think you're talking about IPFilter, and OpenBSD's new PF code.
Now who's talking FUD :)

Perhaps, although I think when seriously considering something like
a firewall, tried and trusted means a hell of a lot. IPFilter would
probably win that race.

I was talking in terms of the actual firewall. If the company in
question knows plenty about Linux and nothing about FreeBSD, I'd go
with a Linux box, merely because when something goes wrong (that
isn't got to do with ipfw/ipchains/ipfilter), then someone knows how
to fix it.

As I said before, I have little to no in-depth experience with
netfilter, I'm aware of it's basic capabilities and had a quick look
at it's features in early 2.4 editions but that's it.
