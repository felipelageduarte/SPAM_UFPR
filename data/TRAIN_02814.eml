The Needle and the damage done>>From the Hoax or Hack Dept:
Digital Needle - A Virtual Gramophone , a reported method to scan yourr
old LPs on a flat bed scanner and then use the resulting images to make
MP3's of the fine playing conatined therein. Its all still sketchy to the
point of possible hoaxdom, but the idea is dang interesting.
