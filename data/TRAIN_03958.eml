Re: Compositing two moviesI can verify that these calls do actually work for synchronization. I =
grab the master time base of the movie I am considering the master =
(which can be arbitrary, so just pick one) and set the master time base =
of the other movies using that. They stay in perfect lock step for the =
rest of the way for me.
