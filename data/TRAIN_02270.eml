[Razor-users] Smrazor, Milter, and Max connectionsWith v2.14 of razor client and using Solaris 9 with sendmail 8.12.5 I have
managed to get smrazor working (milter) -- sort of ... With light server
loads, it seems to do fine; however during peak traffic times (or peak
catalogue server usage???) , the smrazor milter stops and sometime dumps
core as well.  Does anyone know of a limit in terms of number of
messages/minute that can be theoretically processed? I have noticed timeouts
occuring (I set the milter timeout per message to 15 seconds) often in huge
lumps and the occasional "Could not get valid info from Discovery Servers")
?????

I am not using procmail because this [cluster of] server is a gateway on to
5 different pop3 servers (5 different domains), ergo, local users won't work
because of overlapping usernames ...(or insanely huge virtusertable to alias
mappings .....)

Alternatively does anyone have a working, high-capacity milter for this or
any other related ideas???
