You could read about regular expressions.
^kernel$ matches "kernel" and nothimg more.
Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you
might be running in a RH system. Packages like kernel-headers,
kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched. If it just said "kernel", it
would match *all* those packages.
