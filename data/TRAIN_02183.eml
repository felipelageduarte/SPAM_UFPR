Hello=2C

I was hoping to get some feedback or tips on how to setup a PCI serial card=
 (not onboard) for kernel message log capturing. I am using Debian Lenny x6=
4 with the grub2 bootloader.

This might sound like an easy question=2C but does the Linux kernel module =
have to be compiled with the running kernel in order to log messages at boo=
t time? I mean obviously the driver is required to be loaded in Debian GNU/=
Linux when the serial/com device is used in conjunction
with /dev/ttyD[01].

I have found a website providing patches for the chip on the PCI serial car=
d I am using at:
http://izto.org/mcs9865/

Does Debian not include drivers for serial cards in any packages or would t=
hese drivers be considered non-free?

Thanks.
