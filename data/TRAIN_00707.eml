Incorporation in the lilo package would be good.

Unfortunately X remains broken with an error 
about /dev/fb0.

The log is here in case anyone is interested.
    http://carnot.yi.org/dalton.Xorg.0.log
With minimal understanding, I noticed these lines.

(II) Primary Device is: PCI 00@00:02:0
(WW) Falling back to old probe method for vesa
(WW) Falling back to old probe method for fbdev
(II) Loading sub module "fbdevhw"
(II) LoadModule: "fbdevhw"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/linux/libfbdevhw.so
(II) Module fbdevhw: vendor="X.Org Foundation"
	compiled for 1.7.6.901, module version = 0.0.2
	ABI class: X.Org Video Driver, version 6.0
(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such file or directory

I've tried various ideas found with Google.
Remove the intel driver and leave the vesa 
driver installed for example.

Is fb a standalone driver?  Is it an accessory 
to the vesa driver?

Thanks for any ideas,          ... Peter E.
