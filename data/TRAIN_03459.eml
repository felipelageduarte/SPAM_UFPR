If you are using SetMovieTime and  
QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback  you can do everything on the  
secondary thread, after attaching the movie to this thread.

If you are playing the movie you need to play it on the main thread.

Normally you would use a display link callback which calls the  
QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable/QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime  
combo. Kind of smart polling.

If you don't want to poll you can use an ImageAvailableCallback and  
and an input queue but I don't see much benefit from that. The  
overhead of the display link is small and if you suspect that your  
movie has a higher frame rate than the display refresh time you can  
always call QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable multiple times until it  
returns false. Either you can keep up with the input or else you are  
going to drop frames. The ImageAvailableCallback won't  help you there.
