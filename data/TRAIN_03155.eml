If there's such a mass of users wanting to keep kde3 going, it is=20
theoretically possible to collectively fund a developper to do the work you=
=20
want done.=20

quanta and freenet are 2 examples of programs for whom such a thing has bee=
n=20
done

That ofc assumes that:
a) theres's a sufficient mass of users that want to keep kd3 going in at=20

b) they care enough to chip in a little bit=20

=2D-=20
