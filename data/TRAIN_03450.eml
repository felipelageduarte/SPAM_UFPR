Re: exmh bug?
The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.

FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).
