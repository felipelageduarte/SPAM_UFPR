I fear newer drivers. 

The first time I installed nvidia proprietary drivers was 3/4 years ago. 
In that time I was running openSUSE 10.1 and hopefully, nvidia provided 
rpm drivers in their site so installation went straightforward (very easy 
and worked fine: I needed 3D for running Google Earth and Twinview setup 
for the two displays I had attached).

That time (and that time was 4 years ago) I installed the same drivers I 
have nowadays (173.xx). Why I have not updated to the latest ones 
(195.x)? Because "if it works, don't touch it" and I don't needed to do 
fancy things in that computer and the old version was (and is still) 
working without glitches.

Yes, I have also encountered the "Debian-way" plain easy. I thought 
installing nvidia drivers was going to be a headache but truly was not :-)
