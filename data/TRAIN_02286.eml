Debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software, good integrati=

of it throughout the whole distribution and general assumption that it won'=

eat their kittens (yet data loss bugs happen). But whether upstream softwar=

meets users' needs is out of Debian scope. Just find another software/solut=

kindly and wait till somebody else is motivated enough to do it.

Move on. kdepim 4.3 is gone. Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepi=
m=20
from 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating d=
ead=20
horse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. I recommend you to face reality here.

Don't you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales?=

YOU run a dozen of DB servers, YOU don't want another one, YOU don't trust=

MySQL, YOU say KDE 4.4 is inappropriate for stable. Nothing objective and Y=

assume that your truth is an ultimate one. Pet bugs are always RC to the=20

problems with particular piece of software, look for better options or read=
