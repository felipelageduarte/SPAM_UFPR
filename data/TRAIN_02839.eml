Today was not as bad ... apt.cloudmark was the server du jour and
experienced about 800 "Unable to connect .... Reason: Operation now in
progress" out of some 189,000 "bootup[1]"  or roughly 0.5% -- better than
the 1% before but still a bit higher than I would like. I suspect it is
because a previous timeout from razor-agents has a process id that is being
held by an open milter socket. The process id's cycle, the number comes up
again and the error occurs as a duplicate pid occurs. I will tweak my milter
settings to shorten the total time to allow the socket to live per connect.

razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running
this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if
the razor-check script times out first anyway ....

In looking at Core.pm I find a couple possible places where that code might
be. Is it:
    my $select = new IO::Select ($sock);
    my @handles = $select->can_read (15);
    if ($handles[0]) {
        $self->log (8,"Connection established");
        my $greeting = <$sock>;
        # $sock->autoflush; # this is on by default as of IO::Socket 1.18
        $self->{sock} = $sock;
        $self->{connected_to} = $server;
        $self->{select} = $select;
        $self->log(4,"$server >> ". length($greeting) ." server greeting:
$greeting");

        return 1 if $params{discovery_server};
        unless ($self->parse_greeting($greeting) ) {
            $self->nextserver or return $self->errprefix("connect2");
            return $self->connect;
        }
        return 1;
    } else {
        $self->log (3, "Timed out (15 sec) while reading from
$self->{s}->{ip}.");
??????
or
    unless ($sock) {
        $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(
                            PeerAddr => $server,
                            PeerPort => $port,
                            Proto    => 'tcp',
                            Timeout  => 20,
                     );
        unless ( $sock ) {
            $self->log (3,"Unable to connect to $server:$port; Reason:
$!.");
            return if $params{discovery_server};
            $self->nextserver or return $self->errprefix("connect1");
            return $self->connect;
        }
    }
??????
[of course the latter reflects a differenct timeout setting altogether - one
part for proxy, the other for non-proxy]

It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the
time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one
(currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.

I changed the default discovery period to every 12 hours in order to
compensate for the recent sporadic nature of the servers' availability (I
realize that the issue was related to syncing and server upgrades .... but I
might as well play it safe for a while).

catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way
mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I
realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point
I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the
catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue
server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is
just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it
not?)

If I can be of help or if you have details about to participate in this
portion (caching or catalogueing), please let me know.
