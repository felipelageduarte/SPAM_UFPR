[SAdev] [Bug 777] tests to find hand-written HTMLhttp://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=777





------- Additional Comments From daniel@roe.ch  2002-08-28 09:15 -------
3. usage of <p> just like <br> (ie. without </p>) which is obsolete
   (not sure whether some mailers still produce such broken html)
4. tag argument values sometimes enclosed in "", sometimes not
5. colour args without # in front of hex rgb code
6. colour args with non-6-digit rgb code (typo)
7. onMouseOver et al in nonconsistent case throughout the document

Mind, those are just ideas. I'm pretty sure some or even most of them
are not working in practice, but they might be worth checking out.
