So did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning ;-)
One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/

If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next Red Hat Linux release (the final version of the limbos and
(null) betas), which is maybe not really desired. I'll probably test and
see...

PS: The spec file was massively updated and the --with / --without options
that can be used to rebuild the source packages are now listed in the
description ;-)
