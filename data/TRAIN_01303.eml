I hope you also get a 1000 watts power supply to feed that equipment >:-)

So, as you already discarded FlashPlayer as unique source of your 
reboots, I will take a look into:

1/ System overheating (reboots tend to happen due to high temperatures, 
watch the BIOS CPU temps and control the rpm of the fans).

2/ RAM memory modules and voltages. Check the ram dimms are certified for 
you motherboard and also, look into the BIOS voltages are the correct 
ones for you type of ram.

3/ Hard disks health. You can test this with "smartcl".

Being a brand-new computer I would suspect for bad hardware or assembly 
problems :-/
