A La Carte Research recruits for Focus Groups across the country.  Focus Groups<br>
are an easy way to make some extra money for just a couple of hours of your<br>
time.  Each group is only for the purpose of learning your opinions.  You can <br>
be assured that there will be no sales presentation, and you will not be asked <br>
to buy anything.  Everything that is mentioned will be held in the strictest of <br>
confidence.  Focus Groups let you express your opinions on whatever subject is <br>
being discussed and we actually pay you for those opinions.<br>
