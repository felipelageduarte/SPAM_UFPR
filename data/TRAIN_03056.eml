Engineers can't sell !!Do you agree?

There are exceptions of course, but generally, technically minded-people
aren't very 
comfortable wiith having to sell. 

I've spent the last 8 years teaching people in engineering and other
technical companies 
the best way to go about finding new customers, handling enquiries and
closing sales. 

We run the 'Selling for Engineers' seminar in-house for companies of any
size, both in the 
UK and worldwide. 
The content of that seminar is contained in the 'Selling for Engineers'
manual. price £27.00
