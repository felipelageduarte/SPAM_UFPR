Uh? No, there are many problems coming for different sources that can 
affect the browser stability.

Javascript (and flash as well as other plugins) can be one of them, sure, 
but disabling it should cure the issue at all. If it does not, that means 
the problem can lie somewhere (packaging error, xul library or even old 
profile settings).

But "closing tags and getting crash randomly" is not the type of 
behaviour I would associate to a javascript issue becasue javascript code 
should have been rendered when the page loads or when clicking on items, 
but not at page/tab close :-?
