OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
Skip!).  But I have no personal experience of it.
