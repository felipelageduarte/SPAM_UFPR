If they do not agree with the terms, then they cannot access the doc.

In any kind of contract, both parts have to agree the terms. No 
agreement, no contract.

All of us hold our "personal opinions" and nobody can force any user to 
sign any contrat they don't agree. But then the relation between two 
parts stops there. As I don't know what are all of your specific 
situation details, I'm also unaware if this kind of agreement is out of 
place or just fits well within your environment.

In open source world, it is not so uncommom to make people who wants to 
participate in some aspects of sensitive developing (i.e. fsf) to sign 
and agree with their terms, regardless the age of the developers (if they 
are young, they parents have to agree). That is the only way to protect 
(free) the code.

"Quite"? Full, I'd say :-)

But is you who seeks for a "comercial" solution. Only proprietary tools 
(Adobe Reader?) enforce the use of the kind of policies you are looking 
for.

Inside open source world is a bit difficult to find programs or tools 
that make what you are looking for, that is, preventing users to make 
their own :-)
