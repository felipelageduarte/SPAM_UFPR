Re: change of plansHello you two,

I am so sorry Catherine for not writing recently. I have just been vv busybeing a working mother and sometimes it all gets too much you know!! i cannot wait to see you both although we may meet at the airport on the 16/6 as that's the day we're going to france but i will see you both at Bronagh's house for her 30th which we're going to on the way back from the airport. I am so excited about seeing you!!! liitle Eva ( Aine) was born on Tuesday
 She is absolutely incredible. poor Bronagh is 11 dsays over!!
Sounds like you've been having an amazing time. Hope you won't be too depressed to be back!!

Lots of love
