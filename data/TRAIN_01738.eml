Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:

[root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok

Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet.
