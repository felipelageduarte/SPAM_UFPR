Updating JRE in Lenny-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

A website I want to use would allow access unless my java applet is JRE
6 update 13 or higher.  As far as I can figure out the applet provided
by package sun-java6-bin is update 12.

- From the Sun Microsystems site I downloaded file jre-6u19-i586.bin;
moved it to directory /usr/lib/jvm, changed ownership to root:root and
permissions to rwxr-xr-x and ran the binary.  It created a new directory
/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_19 and opened in that directory a number of
subdirectories and files.

Next, I needed to add this new JRE to /etc/alternatives.  Using the
alternatives configurator provided by package galternatives, as root I
selected 'java' as the alternative to configure and added to the options
list /usr/lib/jvm/1.6.0_19/bin/java and finally selected this new option.

After reloading Iceweasel, about:plugins still showed the previous JRE I
was using, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java.

Assuming that I can use a later version of JRE downloaded from Sun on
Iceweasel 3.5, am I on the right track but did not get the newer version
set up correctly, or is there a different way?
