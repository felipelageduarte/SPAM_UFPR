Re: Debian+KDE 4.4.3 (i915 dual screen) (SOLVED)
 Xserver has a well known issue with the i915 driver and it's DRI/DRM 
  limitation to 2048x2048 window size. So the default setup is not working 
  because in recent versions of X it loads drm by default creating 
  configuration that allows only  "clone" of the primary display with DRI 
  enabled on it.
  The impact on kde is that it can not set dual display (only "clone" option 
  is available).
  SOLVED: applying custom xorg.conf with 
        Option "NoAccel" "true"
  in the device section and Position Option into each monitors config.
