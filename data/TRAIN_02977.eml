[ILUG] hwclockHello,
I've got a small problem but still annoying. I upgraded from RH 7.1 to 
RH 7.3 and everything looks ok except that the time is ahead by one 
hour. I've been looking the man files for hwclock and options but it 
simply doesn't work, it gives the following error from he shell as well 
as from the startup while loading the kernel:  hwclock: ioctl() to 
/dev/rtc to turn on update interrupts failed unexpectedly, errno=25: 
Inappropriate ioctl for device.
.... my solution at the time is to enter the setup of the PC and reduce 
the time by one hour (awful!)
Regards,
Felipe
