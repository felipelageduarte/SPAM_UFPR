Re: applets on 32-bit 1.6.0_20There is a known race condition between native background repainting and =
Java drawing in the resize/scrolling case for Java applets embedded in =
the browser process. The reason you don't see this behavior when using =
the out-of-process plugin is because the applet painting is happening in =
a seperate process, and the browser is "pulling the pixels" from the =
Java process when the browser thinks it's a good time to repaint.

I'm not clear why unchecking the "64-bit" checkbox in Java Preferences =
should enable or disable the out-of-process vs. in-process applet =
setting. If your MacBook is actually 32-bit only, you should never even =
see the 64-bit JVMs.
