I would be.  And do we not mean Squeeze?  Lenny has KDE 3.5.10.

I have looked at all those, in addition to KDE 4 and Gnome.  None appeals t=
o=20
me.  Each has something that I strongly dislike or does not have something=

that I like and use a lot.  I would love to be able to upgrade to Squeeze i=
f=20
new(er) hardware dictates, but keep KDE 3.5.  But I am not even almost=20
tempted to go over to the dark side!

s,=20
is being laid to rest.
