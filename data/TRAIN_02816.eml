[Razor-users] Something wrong with Database?Until a few days ago, razor (sdk 2.03, client 2.12) was catching a
decent set of spams.  It seems now, however, that it isn't catching
anything.  I got one email this morning with "ADV:" in the subject
another two or three about how many inches longer I can be.  Did I
miss something recently perhaps regarding configuration changes, etc?

Thanks in advance,

Joe
