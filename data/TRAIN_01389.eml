apt and a hybrid systemBack when I had regular RH7.3 there was nothing better than "apt-get upgrade". But
now I'm running (null) beta and I have these questions:

which version of "apt" can I use, the RH7.3 version or the "rawhide" version?

Is there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null)
through up2date, since I prefer apt to that?

If I can use apt, can I use it to get updates from these 3 different places:
1. the (null) up2date Redhat upgrades
2. the (null) files at Freshrpms.net
3. the regular RH7.3 files from freshrpms.net

Am I asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world?

That's "angle" as in geometry.
