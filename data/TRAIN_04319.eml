So I haven't been totally wasting my time ( ;) ), since my tmta does
support outbound SSL / TLS connections, and indeed, that was a primary
design goal, since I need to push mail out through Gmail's SMTP
servers, which require SSL / TLS.

was primarily meant to be used in conjunction with a normal MTA, and
not to replace one.
