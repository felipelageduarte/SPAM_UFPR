Re: [ILUG] Mail sent to ILUGThanks lads,

I didn't mean to criticise/give offence or anything (someone mailed me off
list who seemed to think I did) but I was just wondering "if anything could
be done" about those messages.
Maybe it was a stupid question, seeing as I know virtually nothing about
mailman, listservs, or server side spam filtering, but thanks for answering
intelligently!
