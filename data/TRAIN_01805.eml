[ILUG] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!)Hi All,

Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.

The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.

Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?

Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

... which is most of the defaults.

USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)

But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.

btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

Colin.
