So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of 
course, there's the "they'll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions." Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?
