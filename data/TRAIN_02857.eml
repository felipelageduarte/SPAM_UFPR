Well, (a) you don't HAVE to upgrade, and (b) what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because SpamAssassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.

If you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:

----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file "spamassassin-wrapper" and chmod +x it
{
echo "From $1 `date`"
sed -e '1{/^From /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $MAIL
----------

And then use

fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %F'

and you should be all set.
