Fact: the C standard does not say anything about machine-level calling
conventions.

Fact: the C standard does not address the behavior which results when
the call site of a function sees a prototype whose return type differs
from the return type present at the definition of the function.

Conclusion: a conforming C compiler could use completely different
techniques for returning 'int' and 'long'.

Conclusion: in such an ABI, machine-level code which arranges for
callers to see an 'int' return value of 0 could easily be written such
that a caller which expects 'long' to see something other than zero.

Conclusion: if you're paranoid about portability, you can't assume
that messages to nil with a 'long' return type will return 0, with a
strict reading of Apple's guarantees.

And note that absolutely nothing in the above is even slightly related
to integer type sizes, type conversions, casts, promotions, the
bit-level representation of the NULL pointer, or any other such
things, so any discussion of them in this context is utterly
pointless.
