No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 

My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 

Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 

For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.
