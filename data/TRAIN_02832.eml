Content management for MP3sDear flatware,

I'm about to undertake a massive project to index/catalog well over one 
thousand CDs that have been ripped to MP3 and set up a server to stream 
them to different rooms in the house. (Yes, I own them all, no I'm not 
broadcasting them to the 'net.) Can anyone give me some recommendations 
as to what (free? opensource?) software is best suited for this task? I 
know there are a few FoRKs out there who have tackled this problem before...

I'd like to be able to dynamically generate play lists from queries like 
"Jazz released between 1950 and 1960" or "Artist such and such between 
these dates" or "Just these artists" or "Just this genre" - you get the 
idea. In addition to having multiple streams that I can tune in to (a la 
DMX), I'd like to be able to browse the database through a web interface 
from other computers in the house and pull specific music down to 
wherever I am.


Thanks,
Elias
