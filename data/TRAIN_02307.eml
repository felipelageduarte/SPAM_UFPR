                  <p> Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up
to $100,000 per month.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per
month, eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making
huge profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and
how to sell. That's where I come in.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information
you need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm
not going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to
pass on the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring
in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions.
The manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:</p>
