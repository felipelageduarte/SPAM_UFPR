My current open applications on a normal work day:
kontact (running kmail and akregator)
konqueror (with khtml kpart)
ark
kdevelop
<app I'm developing at work in Qt>
kopete
konsole
okular

I'm not sure which of these apps I use that aren't a kde app, except the
Qt-only app that I'm doing as a part of my day job.

Sometimes I do have a vmware running to compile test on windows, and
sometimes I need to show off my graphical skills (what skills?) in
inkscape. These are hte only non-kde apps that I actually use.
