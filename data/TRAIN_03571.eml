IKOYI-LAGOS.

FROM THE DESK OF:George Osawa
I am the Chairman Contract Review Committee of National 

Electric Power Authority (NEPA). 
Although this 
proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is 

coming from someone you do not know 
or ever seen
before, but after due deliberations with my colleagues, I 

decided to contact you based on 
Intuition. 

We are soliciting for your humble and confidential 

assistance to take custody of Seventy-
One Million,
Five Hundred Thousand United States 

Dollars.{US$71,500,000.00}. This sum 
(US$71.5M) is an over 
invoice contract sum which is currently in an offshore 

payment account of the Central Bank 
of Nigeria as an 
unclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be 

withdrawn or drafted or pay to any 
recommended 
beneficiary by my committee.

On this note, you will be presented as a contractor to 

NEPA who has executed a contract 
to a tune of the
above sum and has not been paid. 
Proposed Sharing Partern (%): 

1. 70% for me and my colleagues. 

2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.

3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties 

during the cause of this 
transacton.

Our law prohibits a civil servant from operating a 

foreign account, hence we are contacting 
you. If this
proposal satisfies you, do respon as soon as possible 

with the following information: 

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the 

fund. 

2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers. 

Further discussion will be centered on how the fund shall 

be transfer and full details on how 
to accomplish this 
great opportunity of ours.

Thank you and God bless. 

Best regards, 
George Osawa
