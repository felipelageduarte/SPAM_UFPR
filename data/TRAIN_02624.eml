Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got
them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly 
exasperated Rumsfeld and their "UN Inspections not war" banner. That picture
will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and 
France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK. In 
politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names.

For the record, I don't think they even got arrested, which is a shame. It
is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on the nightly
news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.
