I don't find that "joke" funny.  It's not offensive or anything, just the=20

I prefer Debian because more packages are well-maintained under main.  Ubun=
tu=20
provides good support for universe, I guess.  But, the fact that Ubuntu fee=
ls=20
those packages need to be separated just demonstrates that they are "second-
class".

Ubuntu LTS is my second choice, and something I recommend if it is likely t=

the user wants a commercial support contract.  I find the package manager t=

Ubuntu shares with Debian to be enough of an advantage to put it above othe=
r=20
solutions like RHEL or SLE(D/S).

I am comfortable enough to use and maintain RHEL and SLE(S/D) in fairly sim=

environments, if the user has some specific need for one of those systems. =

That's rare, but is often related to third-party hardware or software being=

certified with one of those.
