[IIU] spyware calling home?Hello all
I'm looking for advice. My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying
to access IP 62.17.143.253 without my consent. It has got to the stage where
normal web-browsing is almost impossible.
I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being
called. I contacted that company on 14 July, when the problem first arose
and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply.
A helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal. I
ran this and haven't had a problem again until today.
The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db. (I run adaware with
current ref files every day now).
Any suggestions, please,  for removing whatever the f*** is causing this
from my pc?
Brian
