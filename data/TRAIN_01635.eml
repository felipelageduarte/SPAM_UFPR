What, are they illiterate? Mute? What's their problem? If somebody stops
them from posting web pages, or printing newsletters, or talking on the
phone, or organizing their /own/ conference then that would be wrong.

I don't think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the
physical presence of any particular individual of your choosing - especially
when that individual is busy doing something else and isn't interested.
