You're kidding, right? You can push twice the data, which means faster
CPU to memory utilization for CPU intensive applications. Flash anyone?

It's very relevant. You must not have run into this issue much. 4:4
kernel splits are the best you can do on a 32-bit system, but it comes
at a performance cost. Splitting and performance are never an issue on
64-bit until you've reache 17 EB of RAM.

Whether he will or won't isn't the issue. I'm not discussing use cases,
I'm discussing the facts on why 64-bit is superior to 32-bit.

See above.

I'll give you an example. Use XFS on LVM, and export the mount over NFS.
The nested system calls in this scenario will cause a kernel oops on any
4K 32-bit kernel nearly every time (the default for Debian GNU/Linux,
Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE, etc). On a 64-bit kernel, because you have the
ability to make deeper nested system calls, you have stability in your
infrastructure. Something that couldn't be achieved with a 32-bit kernel.=

The same would be said for a 32-bit application implemented the same
way. Poor software development is hardly an argument against choosing a
CPU architecture.

To each their own. I for one want to get my money out of my hardware. If
you don't want a 64-bit system, then why did you pay for it?
