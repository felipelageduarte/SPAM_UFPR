Is it possible to login as root with GDM3?I've just replaced gdm with gdm3 and find that it doesn't seem to be
possible to login as root any more. Does anyone know if this can be
enabled?

The old login screen settings included lots of options including 'allow
administrator login'. The new version has very few options.
