Eli the Bearded sez: 

    Ever wanted to see an international agreement? There are an awful lot of 
    them here, and the ones I looked at were surprizingly readable. I was 
    looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of 
    Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The 
    Oslo Accords (Israel/PLO agreement of 1993) is another thing much shorter 
    than I had imagined.
