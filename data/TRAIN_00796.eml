dvd::rip on Red Hat 8.0?Hello,

Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.

Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

Thanks,
