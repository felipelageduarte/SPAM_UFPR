Problem with an rpm...Hiya, I just myself an rpm, and when I did -Uvh to upgrade the earlier 
version I had installed (also from my rpm) I got:

[root@spawn i386]# rpm -Uvh mulberry-2.2-b1.i386.rpm
Preparing...                ########################################### 
[100%]
   1:mulberry               ########################################### 
[100%]
error: db3 error(-30998) from db->close: DB_INCOMPLETE: Cache flush was 
unable to complete

Whats the DB_INCOMPLETE mean?

It all seems to have installed ok thou...
