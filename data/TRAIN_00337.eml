>>telnet, as in the original responses.  Google gives several example
scripts
With many thanks for your reply, I found very simple expect telnet examples
(like the case that I am dealing with) so I wrote for the same but it
doesn't work my case. Do you think it may come from the fact that the remote
node is VxWorks or maybe some mistake in my code?
