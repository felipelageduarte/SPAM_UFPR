Re: VM software for personal use?Hi, Richard,

I am running Windows XP 32 bit, Windows XP Pro 64 bit, and, at the
moment, Ubuntu 10.04 in Virtual Box. Every "just works", including the
web, usb attachments, etc.. I recommend it.

This is the non-free Sun version, though, as I didn't have a lot of
luck (it was some time ago) with the packaged version.

YMMV

HTH
