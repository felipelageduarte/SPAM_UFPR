RE: Recommended Viewingmore accurately: someone's dream changes reality for everyone, and
everyone's memory adjusts to perceive the new realities as a continuum,
replete with new pasts and new memories.

ever have dreams that "create" their own history to make their irrealities
plausible and authentic feeling?

ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day?
i'm sure it's some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is
still cycling thru - like a deja vu, triggered by memory processes, where
you don't actually remember but you feel like you're remembering.

ggggggggg

Isn't this the story where someone's "Dream" has the ability to change
reality -- then you find the whole world is their dream?
