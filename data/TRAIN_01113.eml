 Scissors are a snip for Third World
 From Richard Owen in Rome
 
 
 
 IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the
 millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from
 passengers’ hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized
 as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain
 is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World
 hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail
 files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for
 them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the
 X-ray scanners. 
 
 Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that
 scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
 America. 
 
 He told Corriere della Sera that he had “plucked up the courage” to ask the
 authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a
 retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure
 sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. 
 
 Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,
 Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. “In such countries, what we think of as a
 personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.” 
 
 The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports.
