This is hardly a new book.  In fact, it was written in the days of Woody.
(Woody -> Sarge -> Etch -> Lenny -> Squeeze)
And parts of it are obsolete.  But the author focuses on the core stuff of
Unix/Linux, and so most of it is still current.  It's an excellent guide
for how to accomplish common computing tasks in Linux, usually with a
command line tool, and the author has a clear bent toward Debian.

This is the original version of the book, and it is free.  There's an
expanded 2nd Edition available in hard copy for a fee.
