[ILUG] cups question I seem to be having a little trouble with it. My printers.conf is:

<DefaultPrinter lp>
Info Hp4050
Location locals
DeviceURI ipp://192.168.2.90:9100/
State Idle
Accepting Yes
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
</Printer>

 and cupds uses that to make a printcap of:

lp:

 Sounds dodgy to me. If someone has an example printers.conf/printcap for
a JetDirect printer, I'd appreciate it if they sent it on.
