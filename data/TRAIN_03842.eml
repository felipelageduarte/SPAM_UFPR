To my knowledge, no part of the Bluetooth frameworks documentation
says anything about thread safety, and for that reason you must assume
that it is only safe to use from the main thread.

Also, a thread's run loop will only run if it has either run loop
sources or timers attached; the fact that NSRunLoop's -run ever
returns means that it has neither. This is what I would expect based
on your -startBlueToothThread: method, as it doesn't appear to create
a source or timer. If you wanted to keep the thread alive, I would
attach a dummy timer to the run loop that fires after some
extraordinary amount of time. (Assuming you're not using the Bluetooth
APIs on the thread...)
