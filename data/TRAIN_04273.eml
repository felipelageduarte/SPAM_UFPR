Hmmm...  I just upgraded from my modified 2.31 to a slightly modified 2.40
(I add a routine to EvalTests) and get:

Sep  2 15:32:24 eclectic spamd[20506]: razor2 check skipped: No such file o=

"log" on unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Clien=

line 22.=20

I haven't quite figured out why yet, more to come.
