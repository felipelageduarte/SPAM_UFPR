In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale, 
but once something is out in the world, the "creator" loses control... If I 
buy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by 
you're definition, he just stole from you.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called "advertising": "buy one, get one free", "free shipping on any order 
over $25", "buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free", "free popcorn 
with any movie rental", "free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter", 
"the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.
