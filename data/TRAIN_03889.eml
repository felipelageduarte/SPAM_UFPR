If it strikes you as being ridiculously bizarre, you're probably right.  
Because it is ridiculous, and bizarre.

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to 
invent a plausible lie.
