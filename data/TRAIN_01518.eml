I ran into a similar issue some time ago (and found the solution on a 
vnc mailing list, in case you have further problems).
If you closed your vnc session by *logging out*, what happens is that 
your session (gnome) is no longer active, but vnc is not concerned.

The workaround that was suggested to me is to *not* have vncstartup exec 
the session, but rather launch a session and cleanup afterwards, ie

# wrong
#exec gnome-session

# right
gnome-session
vncserver -kill $DISPLAY

If you grok the shell you'll probably use the trap command to make sure 
that cleanup is done no matter what, but that's just a detail

good luck
