Hi there,

I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock
interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
knowledge.

Regards,
Anthony Geoghegan
