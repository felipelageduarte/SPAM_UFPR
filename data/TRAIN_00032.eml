NB: This is my best recollection; I'm not looking this up right now.  Pleas=
e=20
check my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.

Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, whi=
ch=20
I believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came=
=20
from tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and=20
should be in btrfs.  The final edge reiserfs had was above-average=20
flushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs h=
ave=20
likely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching=
=20
system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.

Not really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very=
=20
long time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated=
 to=20
use the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that=
=20
will not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the=
=20
reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t=
he=20
ext2/3/4 or xfs code.

In addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less=
=20
attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a=
way=20
from it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outs=
ide=20
of generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which=20
allows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying;=
=20
such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an=
d=20
fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The=
=20
source will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in f=
ile=20
systems are not interested in reiserfs.

There's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no=
=20
pressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20
systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser=
fs.
