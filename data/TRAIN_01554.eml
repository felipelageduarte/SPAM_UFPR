a problem with apt-getHi,

In my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.

For kernel-sources, I get :

Package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3

on running apt-get install kernel-source

Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is 
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.

Thanks,
Thomas
