Hmmm, strange. Well maybe KMail does address completion more directly than=
=20
via KAddressBook. There might be a component in KDEPIM libs doing that for=
=20
KMail. For - just for looking up email address - KMail really calls into=20
Akonadi.

But AFAIK it doesn't use Akonadi - through what ways ever - for anything=20
other than retrieving contact data. Thus the use of Akonadi could not be=20
that wide-spread in KMail.

However, KDEPIM will use Akonadi more and more, so IMHO its better to have=
=20
Akonadi improved and fixed than to remove the Akonadi dependency in KMail=20
temporarily.
