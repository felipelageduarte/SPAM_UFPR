Hi Carlos Miranda Molina, please work on your message trimming 
technique, the OP was already hinted toward non-free by Camale√≥n earlier 
in this thread so I could only assume he was aware of the need to use 
non-free. I just mentioned that for me fglrx from Sid is working fine.
I am sorry if "everyone" is wrong, but your message trimming suggest I 
am "everyone" all by myself...
I like your prompt by the way.
