If what you say is true, then he is wasting his time (and ours) by posting
to *any* list.  If he can
only receive e-mails from fellow Cubans, then even if there are fellow
Cubans who could help him and are subscribed to the list, they will never
receive his posts, since the list server is outside of Cuba.  In fact,
no-one in Cuba could even subscribe to the list, since they will never
receive the confirmation e-mail.  And if they don't have web access
either, then posting to *any* list is an exercise in futility for Cubans.
Lists are black holes to Cubans.  Everything goes in, nothing comes out.
Apparently he hasn't figured that out yet.
