yep, I reckon that's likely.

BTW I'm hearing reports about problems resolving spamassassin.org.
Anyone else noticing this?  if it's serious I'll see if I can get
Mark Reynolds to add a 2ndary in the US, to go with the primaries
in Oz.

I think this is a Razor bug/glitch triggered when file permissions
don't allow its own log system to work.  At least that's the report
I heard on the Razor list in the past...

Theo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?

I won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just
put a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead.   I will of course
tag with a release *label* though.
