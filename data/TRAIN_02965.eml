The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of
30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now
come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:

1998 - DMCA
1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act
1992 - Audio Home Recording Act
1976 - Copyright Act amendment
1972 - Copyright Act amendment

It is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976
Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that
the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio
recordings after First Sale even if you are not "making copies" in any
commercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are
explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.
