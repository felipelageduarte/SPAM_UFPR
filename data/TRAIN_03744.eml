Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA.

> We are a diverse group with retirees, computer professionals, other =
professionals, educators, and some children that come with there =
parents.  We meet in a nursing home but no one from the nursing home is =
a member.  One member does volunteer work there.  Our meeting place is =
in a dining area with WiFi/Airport available.  We are very fortunate to =
be near Dave Marra, Apple Senior Systems Engineer, who is a speaker at =
many MUGs including ours.

> Our meetings involve both member presentation and invited guests.  We =
always try to answer questions and solve problems.  We have a local =
Apple Store that has been absolutely zero help except some of our =
members always have the latest gizmos, like iPads, the day they are =
introduced.  We also have several Apple vendors and an Apple third party =
manufacturer in the area.  They are much more of a help.

> Since we don't have any major common interests except Mac/Apple, we =
normally stick with Apple software and low-cost or no-cost third party =
software.  We don't do many programs on Adobe products but do some on =
Microsoft products.  Some members are into other Unix systems such as =
Linux and open-source software.

treat.

is Southeast Pennsylvania outside the Philadelphia area.
