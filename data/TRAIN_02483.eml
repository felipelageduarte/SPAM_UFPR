I don't think that you need "# updatedefaultentry=true" if you are
using "default saved". IIUC, I only has any meaning in the case of
"default x" where x is a number.

IIUC, "# savedefault=true" will append "savedefault" to the menu
entries and, booting from one of those entries turns it into the
default at the next boot if you choose "default saved".

I have not tried "default saved" with grub1, but with grub2 it will
not work (the first time that you set it) if you don't run
"grub-set-default x" where x is the default entry that you want (the
count starts with 0).
