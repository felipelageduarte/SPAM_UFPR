Aaron Swartz has written up a warchalking FAQ that addresses the shibboleths 
and paranoia about discovering, marking and using wireless connectivity. 

    Is that illegal? 

    Although I am not a lawyer, I don't think it's illegal to make chalk marks 
    on the sidewalk. I know a lot of hopscotch players who'd be worried if it

    something they need (an Internet connection).
