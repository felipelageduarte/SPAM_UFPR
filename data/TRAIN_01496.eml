I thought that too but with these two cards

 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV280 [Radeon 9200 PRO] (Secondary) (rev 01)
 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200] (rev a1)

/var/log/Xorg.0.log has no problem reporting

  (II) RADEON(0): EDID data from the display on output: DVI-0 ----------------------
  (II) RADEON(0): Manufacturer: DEL  Model: 400d  Serial#: 1094992983
  (II) RADEON(0): Year: 2006  Week: 2

for the radeon card, and

  (II) NOUVEAU(0): EDID for output VGA-1
  (II) NOUVEAU(0): Manufacturer: DEL  Model: 400c  Serial#: 1094992983
  (II) NOUVEAU(0): Year: 2006  Week: 2

for the nvidia card. Available resolutions and EDID (in hex) are also
recorded.

With an onboard nvidia adaptor

 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NVCrush11 [GeForce2 MX Integrated Graphics] (rev b1)

there is no EDID information in Xorg.0.log. I get 1024x768 on the console
and in X. The native resolution of the panel is 1280x1024. This is a step
up on the nv driver which will give only 800x600 without being told
otherwise in xorg.conf.

So I'm disinclined to blame the behavior of the monitor.

Not the same card as my onboard nvidia but this is close to the behaviour
I've experienced:

Which one do you use? TerminusBold 20x10, 22x11, 24x12 and 28x14 all lead
to screen corruption for me. 32x16 behaves.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/544739

may have some bearing on my observations.
