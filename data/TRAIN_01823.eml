We don't know what's the issue with this site exactly. It looks like a
commercial showstopper not a limitation in flash or it look like it's a
commercial limitation, something I would not consider as flash problem. But
if the  guy says it's working in 32bit then it's probably a 64bit flash for
linux issue, for real ... strange things happen all the time.
