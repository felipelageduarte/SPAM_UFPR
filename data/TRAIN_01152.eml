Well, personally I'm not against as long as it's made clear to
everyone. And you've also got to remember that volunteerism is not
seen in the same way all over the world. We don't really have a board
as such but we've given free membership to some individuals that have
helped out a lot in the past (current annual fee is AED150, around
$40).
