Re: 2.5.0 weirdnessOK. I have since verified that sometimes I lose focus and sometimes X11 pops
to the front even when another application is runing. For example, I'm using
powerpoint, and then...gee, all my xterms. Hello, xterms. But Powerpoint
still has "focus" in the sense that my keypresses go to powerpoint, which is
hidden behind my xterms.

But here's the thing--this all started with 2.5.0. This bug is not present
in the Snow Leopard standard install. So perhaps there *is* something
XQuartz.app can do about it?
