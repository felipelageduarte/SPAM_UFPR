Supporting and testing unreleased or beta software is the biggest problem. =
If=20
you want your pet issue fixed, you have to get akonadi from trunk, build it=
,=20
test whole Debian's KDE 4.4.x *extensively* with it including third party=20
akonadi plugins like googledata one. Finally severe regressions should be=20
fixed. For packaging, README.Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB=
=20
backends since there won't be GUI for it. And when this is done, that akona=
di=20
could be considered for stable.

In other words, you have to do part of upstream release management work=20
without knowing the code well. You can be sure that upstream won't be pleas=
ed=20
with Debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi. But maybe you can=20
convince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate Debian needs. The=
re=20
is lots of work to be done.

Initial akonadi trunk packaging is at [1]. I have been using it with SQLite=
=20
for over a month now. Yet I don't use akonadi features extensively (not eve=
n=20
addressbook or korganizer) so I can't tell much about quality of the code. =
But=20
I can tell you that if you don't step up, this plan probably won't make it.

It might be a problem for some people (short on RAM on their machines), not=
 a=20
problem for others. Generally, you need to stop talking and generalizing wh=
at=20
you don't know (like keep claiming that releasing with different versions=20
wasn't considered despite obvious proof on the contrary).

PostgreSQL/SQLite is a FEATURE, it is not a bug which has to be fixed no=20
matter what. If you want it in, stop ranting and start working on it. Give=
=20
fewer lessons how Debian works and actually do something useful towards you=

goal. Especially since the lack of technical knowledge or background should=
=20
not be the problem for you.
