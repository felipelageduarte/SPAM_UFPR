Setting up Java1.6 on OS 10.5Hi all,

I'm trying to get Java1.6 working on my MacBook Pro 1,1 which has  
10.5.8 on it. I've downloaded a package from the OpenJDK project, and  
I've got it setup using the directions
that I've found at the bottom of this thread:

http://www.mailarky.com/thread.php?page=1&id=197627

where I've setup an OpenJDK6.jar folder in my ~/Library/Java/ 
JavaVirtualMachines directory. I've got the proper directory  
structure, but no luck in having it recognized by the
/usr/libexec/java_home function. Nor is it recognized if I try to  
symlink it as a the 1.6.0 folder in the /System/Library/.../Versions  
path. I think then the culprit may be my Info.plist
file.

Does anyone have any experience with doing this setup? I've included  
what my Info.plist looks like below to see if it's not formatted  
properly.

Thanks in advance.
