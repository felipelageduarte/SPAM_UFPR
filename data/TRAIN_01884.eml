>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have "something
roughly equivalent" (ie "it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on "who can I work with" and only
maybe 10% on "how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?"
